           flags are the _only_ error.
       . Parse base flags for basepeak benchmarks in peak-only runs
       . Disambiguate different flags with the same text (when possible)

         publication at SPEC
     - Fixed config rewriting bug that would probably break settings added by
         the tools to stored configs
     - Fixed a BIG bug in included config files; now things should work as if
         they really are inserted in place of the include directive.
     - Added EXTRA_*OPTIMIZE flags, which come immediately after the flags in
         OPTIMIZE (or the language-specific variant)

     - Allow ogo's environment variable warning to be disabled
     - Add '-S' synonym for runspec's --define
     - Added irritating warning for using "stock" config files

Version 89 - 17 March 2006
===========
  1) Tools changes:
     - Flag parsing and reporting:
       . Fixed compiler-specific flag matching
       . Fixed problems with peak (basepeak) numbers and flags in base-only runs
       . Fixed problems with textual flag substitution
       . Make sure that per-flag compiler restrictions refer to existing flags
       . Put a section TOC at the tops of flag dumps
       . Flags included by name may now also carry along parameters
       . Fixed substitution of backreferences into flag description text
       . Improved error messages for "should never happen" tools errors
       . Fixed flag crash on flags (like "g++") that contain regexp metachars
       . Fixed flag storage and parsing errors on mixed-language benchmarks
       . Changed header class "system" to its own element: platform_settings
       . Flag description text will now be enclosed in <p> in the absence of
          other markup
       . Allow only correct class names for <header> sections in flag files
       . Flags are now presented with as little redundancy as possible
       . Made flag "splitters" in flag descriptions work as documented
       . Tweaked default regular expression construction for flag descriptions
       . Fixed problems with stored compile options on Windows
       . Fixed problem removing "bad" flag descriptions that match 100+ times
       . Fixed problems with --review and non-display flags
       . Mark results with unknown flags as invalid
       . Recognize and reject empty flag regexps
       . Disallow compiler-class flags from appearing in non-compiler variables
       . Disallow portability flags from appearing in non-portability variables
       . Removed phase (compilation/link) markings from flags
       . Removed commas from flag lists
       . Added debug output for flag substitutions
       . Made flag substitutions happen in-place
       . Added more vertical whitespace to the flag lists
       . Broke up sections by tuning level, where applicable
       . Fixed link-section options output for mixed-language benchmarks
       . Reduced options output for non-FDO ONESTEP builds
       . Fixed flag parsing for ONESTEP builds
       . Reworked per-language section headers
       . Removed misleading file/line number information from XML parser error
          messages
       . Corrected erroneous flag merging for different flags with the same
          flag text
       . Merge flags across tuning levels on a per-benchmark as well as per-
          language basis
     - Formatter and results output:
       . Fixed formatter crash when only one benchmark of a particular
           langauge is run
       . Fixed output of peak-only results in CSV
       . Fixed config file rewriting problems with included files
       . Fixed --fake build output on Windows
       . Fixed "accessor not found" warnings for build failures
       . Fix headers on generated HTML so that IE doesn't barf on it
       . The submission check "formatter" will only run for actual reportable
           runs, or if explicitly requested
       . Finished PostScript and PDF outputs
       . Made --graph_min and --graph_max absolute
       . Added --graph_auto for reasonable graph scales (not the default)
       . 'reportable' is only enforced for actual runs
       . Made text and HTML the default output formats; "all" is unchanged
       . Auto-link URLs in errors section in PDF output
       . Fixed --reportable's interaction with --fakereport
       . Add --mockup/--fakereportable to generate fake reportable results
       . Abort (not crash) when benchmark languages don't match in base and peak
     - Install-time changes:
       . Fixed WinZip munge check and bogus "Installation completed!" messages 
          for Windows install
       . Provided a time estimate for installs on Windows
       . Fixed WinZip munge check for installs on Windows
       . Improved the "shrc isn't writable" error message
       . Fixed hang with uninstall.sh when running on an uninstalled tree
       . install.sh now deals with output from ls aliased to 'ls -F'
     - Runspec will print the iteration number for multi-iteration runs
     - Fixed problem with hw_ncpu field not being generated for runs
     - Add notice when attempting to access version check URL
     - Included username in log file header
     - Fixed detail in messages from check_exe()
     - Fixed placement of log file separator lines during build phase
     - Fixed up "go" aliases in *shrc
     - Fixed bogus accessor warning when n-pass compile fails
     - Revised the runspec usage message (--help)
     - Now the version files are "clickable" for Windows users
     - Require extensions to refer to config file sections by default; setting
         allow_extension_override=1 gives back the old behavior
     - Runspec can now run an un-relocated specdiff
     - Added ability to stuff all files (executables, run dirs, results, logs)
         into a subdirectory of their normal homes (set with expid)
     - Added ability to do all writes (except config files) to a separate
         tree (set with output_root)
     - Made --username act as expected
     - Resolved several problems in Makefile.defaults:
       1. The comments and contents of LDLANGFLAGS were incorrect
       2. Several unused variables (per-language LDOPT) were removed
       3. User-settable variables were not cleared; this could allow
          environment variables to pollute the build environment.
     - Added check for illegal characters in settings for ext and mach
     - shrc: Added "ogo", a variant of "go"
     - Fixed cleaning actions (clean, trash, clobber, nuke)
     - 'nuke' action is now 'scrub'
     - SPEC_CPU2006_NO_RUNDIR_NUKE is now SPEC_CPU2006_NO_RUNDIR_DEL
     - extract_compopts: Added ability to dump options from config files
     - Replaced "run" action with "only_run" (run without validation)
     - Made "run" action synonymous with "validate" (normal run with validation)
     - Made no-validation runs not an error
     - Fixed mis-ordered output at the top of the log file
     - Keep '--fake --rebuild' runs from removing built binaries
     - Make sure that output from --fake is always produced
     - Abort early if not all benchmarks are available for a --reportable
       --nobuild run
     - Quieted --reportable warnings
     - cshrc: Functionality tweaks to bring it closer to shrc
     - NDEBUG is defined for all C and C++ benchmarks
     - Changed per-benchmark basepeak from lowest median to just 'base' scores
     - Only enforce "no individual benchmark selection" rule for reportable
        runs when the action is 'validate', 'run', or 'report'
     - Corrected addition of unwanted newlines in log output
     - Added supplemental warning for possibly wrongly split config file lines
     - Log config file reads
     - Fixed log line wrapping bugs (for both screen and log file) logging
