<h1 style="margin-bottom:0">Errata for SPEC CPU2006</h1>
<p style="font-size:80%">Last updated: 2 Aug 2006  jh</p>

<p>This document describes known problems in SPEC CPU2006. </p> 
<ul>
<li><p>Problems may be added in the <a href="#open">Open</a> section from time to time.  For the latest version of this
document, you should check  <a
href="http://www.spec.org/cpu2006/Docs/errata.html">http://www.spec.org/cpu2006/Docs/errata.html</a>.) </p></li>
<li><p>When problems are fixed, they are moved to the <a href="#closed">Closed</a> section. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Note: When updating this document, please do not ever re-use problem numbers.</p>

<h2 id="open">Open Problem Reports</h2>

<h3 id="problem1">1. Missing example-advanced.cfg</h3>  
  <ul>
  <li>Problem summary: the advanced example config file has not been updated</li> 
  <li>Details: SPEC CPU2000 had a config file which demonstrated many advanced features.  For SPEC CPU2006, the advanced
  example has not yet been developed.</li>
  <li>Workaround: an advanced example might be added to <a href="http://www.spec.org/cpu2006/">www.spec.org/cpu2006</a> at a
  later date; in the meantime, there are brief examples throughout <a href="config.html">config.html</a>.  You might
  also find that many of the cpu2000 features in 
  <a href="http://www.spec.org/cpu2000/docs/example-advanced.cfg">www.spec.org/cpu2000/docs/example-advanced.cfg</a>
  still work, but they have not been tested in the cpu2006 environment.</li>
  </ul>

<h3 id="problem2">2. Parallel builds aren't parallel on Windows</h3>
  <ul>
  <li>Problem summary: Benchmark builds on Windows effectively ignore the <tt>-j</tt> flag.</li> 
  <li>Details: Because the Windows build of GNU make requires <tt>sh.exe</tt> to be present in order to do parallel
      builds.  No <tt>sh.exe</tt> is shipped with the SPEC CPU2006 tools, so using the option to do parallel builds
      will only result in a warning and a normal serial build.</li>
  <li>Workaround: None.</li>
  </ul>

<h3 id="problem3">3. Reporting of seconds</h3>
  <ul>
  <li>Problem summary: Seconds are rounded to 3 digits in some reports</li> 
  <li><p>Details: For certain values, the SPEC tools print 3 significant digits.  This is intentional.  For example, if one
  system has a SPECint_rate2006 performance of 1234.456 and another has a SPECint_rate2006 performance of 1229.987, it is
  arguable that the performance of these systems is not materially different.  Given the reality of run-to-run variation
  (which is, sometimes, on the order of 1%), it makes sense to report both systems' SPECint_rate2006 as 1230.</p>
  <p>There was agreement that it is acceptable to round SPEC's <b>computed metrics</b> to 3 significant digits.  However, it
  has been noted that the argument is weaker for rounding of original <b>observations</b>.  In particular, if we wish to
  acknowledge the reality of run to run variation, then it seems reasonable to report a time of 1234.456 seconds using an
  integral number of seconds (1234), rather than rounding to the nearest 10 seconds (1230).</p>
  <p>Results posted on SPEC's web site in reports such as the HTML, PDF, and text formats will use 3 significant digits for
  computed metrics, but seconds larger than 1000 will be reported as an integral number of seconds.  A future maintenance
  update of SPEC CPU2006 will behave the same way.  But for SPEC CPU2006 V1.0, you may notice that reports you generate for
  yourself round seconds to three significant digits.</p></li>
  <li>Workaround: The above described rounding occurs only in the reports intended for humans, such as PDF, HTML, and text.
  But all available digits are still included in the raw files (<tt>.rsf</tt>), and in the file intended for use by
  spreadsheets (<tt>.csv</tt>).  Therefore, if you prefer to see as many digits as possible, or would prefer to do your own
  rounding, then this is <span class="alarm">another good reason to use CSV output format</span>.  See the documentation for
  <a href="runspec.html#output_format"> <span class="ttnobr">runspec --output_format csv</span></a>.</li>
  </ul>

<h3 id="problem4">4.  Unexpected message installing on Solaris/x86</h3>  
  <ul>
  <li>Problem summary: unexpected "killed" messages occur while installing on Solaris/x86</li> 
  <li>Details: The lines shown in red below should not be present:
<pre>
./install.sh

SPEC CPU2006 Installation

Top of the CPU2006 tree is '/data1/kumaran/kit97'
<span class="alarm">specbzip2: Cannot find /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
Killed
specbzip2: Cannot find /lib/ld-linux.so.2
Killed</span>

There appears to be only one valid toolset:

solaris-x86                   Recommended for Solaris 10 and later
                              Built on Solaris 10 with Sun Studio 11
</pre>                                                                                                                                    
  </li>
  <li>Workaround: The lines can safely be ignored.  The suite figures out which tool sets to offer you by trying them.  The
  above lines come from toolsets that are not actually compatible with Solaris-x86.  But a moment later, the correct toolset
  is found and offered.  Please ignore the extraneous messages.</li>
  </ul>
