<h1>SPEC CPU2006 System Requirements</h1>

<p style="font-size:80%">Last updated: 3 June 2006 jh/mc/jr
<br />(To check for possible updates to this document, please 
see <a href="http://www.spec.org/cpu2006/Docs/"> http://www.spec.org/cpu2006/Docs/</a> ) </p>

<p>To run and install SPEC CPU2006, you will need:</p>

<ol>
   <li><p> A computer system running UNIX, Microsoft Windows, or Mac OS X.  The benchmark suite includes a toolset.
   Pre-compiled versions of the toolset are provided that are expected to work with:</p>
     <ul>
      <li>AIX: PowerPC systems running AIX 5L V5.1 or later</li>
      <li>HP-UX: IPF running HP-UX 11iv2</li>
      <li>HP-UX: HP-UX 11iv2 on PA-RISC </li>
      <li>Irix: MIPS running IRIX</li>
      <li>Linux/PPC: PowerPC-based Linux systems with GLIBC 2.2.1+, built on YellowDog</li>
      <li>MacOS X: MacOS X 10.2.8+ on PowerPC G3+ </li>
      <li>MacOS X: MacOS X 10.4.3+ on x86 </li>
      <li>Redhat 6.2: x86- or x64-based Linux systems with GLIBC 2.1.3+</li>
      <li>RHAS: Red Hat Enterprise Linux AS 3, and/or SGI ProPack 3</li>
      <li>SLES: SuSE Enterprise Linux 9 on IA64</li>
      <li>Solaris: SPARC with Solaris 8 and later</li>
      <li>Solaris: x86 or x64 with Solaris 10 and later</li>
      <li>SuSE: 64-bit AMD64 Linux systems</li>
      <li>Windows: Microsoft Windows XP and Windows Server</li>
     </ul>
     <p>For systems not listed in above, such as earlier or later versions of the above systems, you may find that the tools
     also work, but SPEC has not tested them.  Windows systems that are not based on NT, such as Windows 95, Windows 98, and
     Windows ME, will definitely NOT work.  Please see the <a href="#port">Portability Notes</a> below.</p>

     <p>In addition to the above list, there are several toolsets that are provided as a courtesy.  These toolsets are
     expected to work, but have been tested much less extensively.   More importantly, the benchmarks themselves have not
     been ported to these systems, so if you use one of them, you should be prepared to spend time on the porting effort.
     Please see the <a href="#port">Portability Notes</a> below.</p>

     <ul>
      <li>FreeBSD 5.4: x86, built with GCC 3.4.2</li>
      <li>FreeBSD 6.x: x86, built with GCC 3.4.4</li>
      <li>NetBSD 2.1: x86, built with GCC 3.3.3</li>
      <li>OpenBSD 3.8: x86, built with GCC 3.3.5</li>
      <li>Tru64: Alpha Tru64 UNIX V4.0F or later</li>
     </ul>
   
   </li>


   <li><p> A DVD drive </p></li>

   <li><p>Memory: typically 1GB on 32-bit systems, exclusive of OS/overhead; but more may be required:</p>
   
   <ul>
      <li><p>The CPU2006 benchmarks (code + workload) have been designed to fit within about 1GB of physical memory, which is
      within the capabilities of systems that allow user applications to use 32 bits of virtual memory (i.e. 4GB of virtual
      address space).</p></li>

      <li><p> SPEC is aware that some systems that are commonly described as "32-bit" may provide a smaller number of bits to
      user applications, for example if one or more bits are reserved to privileged code.  SPEC is also aware that there are
      many ways to spend profligate amounts of virtual memory.  Therefore, although 32-bit systems are within the design
      center for the CPU2006 suites, SPEC does not guarantee any particular memory size for the benchmarks, nor that they
      will necessarily fit on all systems that are described as 32-bit. </p></li>

      <li><p>The 1GB of RAM for the benchmarks (in 32-bit mode) does not include space needed for the operating system and
      other non-SPEC tasks on the system under test.</p></li>
    
      <li><p>Typically, 64-bit environments will require 2GB for some of the benchmarks in the suite.</p></li>

      <li><p>Attempting to run the suite with insufficient memory is strongly discouraged, as you will end up
      measuring the speed of your paging file, not the speed of your system running compute intensive workloads.</p></li>

      <li><p>More memory will be needed if you run multi-copy SPECrates: generally 1GB for 32-bit, 
      or 2GB for 64-bit, for each copy you plan to run.</p></li>
    </ul></li>

   <li><p> Disk space:</p>

       <ul>
        <li><p>Typically you will need at least 8GB of disk space to install and run the suite.  However, space needs can
        vary greatly depending upon your usage and system.  The 8GB estimate is based on the following:</p>

     <ol>
        <li>Unpacked and installed, the suite takes approximately 1.5 to 2GB of disk space.</li>

        <li>When compiling your own binaries, the size of the build directories and resulting objects will vary depending
        upon your system, compiler, and compiler options.  Estimate at least 2 to 3GB of disk space per build.  If you plan
        to maintain multiple sets of binaries, each set will need space.</li>

        <li>A single run (using binaries you have built, or using pre built binaries from a separate source) takes an
        additional 2 to 3GB of disk space.  
  
         <p>Note: If you plan to run SPECrate with multiple copies, estimate an additional 2 to 3GB of disk space per copy.
         Note that SPECrate must be run using a single file system, so large runs will likely require some form of hardware
         or software disk striping.</p></li>
     </ol></li>

        <li><p>Minimum requirement: It is possible to run with about 5GB of disk space if: you are running only single-CPU
        metrics; you delete the build directories after the build is done; and you clean run directories between tests.  See
        the discussion of disk space in <a href="runspec.html#section1.4.2">runspec.html</a> for more information about
        managing disk space.  </p></li>
       </ul>

         assume that you are reading the page from a directory that also contains the other SPEC CPU2006 documents.  If by
         some chance you are reading this web page from a location where the links do not work, try accessing the referenced
         documents at one of the following locations:</p>
         <ul class="commentaryul">
         <li class="commentaryli"><a href="http://www.spec.org/cpu2006/Docs/">www.spec.org/cpu2006/Docs/</a></li>

         </ul>
         <p class="commentaryend"> </p>
         </li>




   <li><p> Since SPEC supplies only source code for the benchmarks, you will need either:</p>

      <ol style="list-style:lower-alpha">
      <li>A set of compilers for the result(s) you intend to measure:

          <ol style="list-style:decimal">
          <li>For SPECint2006: Both C99 and C++98 compilers</li>
          <li>For SPECfp2006:  All three of C99, C++98 and Fortran-95 compilers</li>
          </ol>

       <p>--or--</p></li>

       <li>A pre-compiled set of benchmark executables, given to you by another user of the same revision of SPEC CPU2006,
       and any run-time libraries that may be required for those executables.</li>
       </ol>

      <p>Please notice that you cannot generate a valid CPU2006 result unless you meet all of requirement 5.a.1 or 5.a.2 or
      5.b.  For example, if you are attempting to build the floating point suite but lack a Fortran-95 compiler, you will not
      be able to measure a SPECfp2006 result.</p></li>

</ol>

<h2 id="port">Portability Notes</h2>

   <p>SPEC CPU2006 is a source code benchmark, and portability of that source code is one of the chief goals of SPEC CPU2006.
   SPEC has invested substantial effort to make the benchmarks portable across a wide variety of hardware architectures,
   operating systems, and compilers.  During the development of SPEC CPU2006 testing was done on over 15 different hardware
   architectures and operating systems (including many variations of Unix, Linux, Microsoft Windows and the Mac OS). </p>

   <p>Despite SPEC's testing efforts, certain portability problems are likely to arise from time to time.  For example:</p>
    <ul>

       <li> <p>Some platforms may not have a Fortran-95 compiler available.</p></li>

       <li> <p>Some older compilers may not include all the features needed to run the entire suite.</p></li>

       <li> <p>Sometimes, a new release of a compiler or operating system may introduce new behavior that is incompatible
       with one of the benchmarks.</p></li>

    </ul>

   <p>If you visit <a href="http://www.spec.org/cpu2006/">http://www.spec.org/cpu2006/</a>  and look up results for SPEC
   CPU2006, you will find combinations of OS and compiler versions that are known to work.  For example, if a vendor reports
   a SPECint2006 result on the SuperHero 4 using SuperHero Unix V4.0 with SuperHero C V4.0 and SuperHero C++ V4.0, you may
   take that as an assertion by the vendor that the listed versions of Unix, C, and C++ will successfully compile and run the
   SPEC CINT2006 suite on the listed machine.</p>

   <p>For systems that have not (yet) been reported by vendors, SPEC can provide limited technical support to resolve
   portability issues.  See <a href="techsupport.html">techsupport.html</a> for information.</p>
