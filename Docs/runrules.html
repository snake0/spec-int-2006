<h2 id="rule_1">1 Philosophy</h2>
<p>This section is an overview of the purpose, definitions, methods, and assumptions for the SPEC CPU2006 run rules.</p>

<h3 id="rule_1.1">1.1 Purpose</h3>
<p>The purpose of the SPEC CPU2006 benchmark and its run rules is to further the cause of fair and objective CPU benchmarking.  The rules help
ensure that published results are meaningful, comparable to other results, and reproducible.  SPEC believes that the user
community benefits from an objective series of tests which serve as a common reference.</p> 

<p>Per the SPEC license agreement, all SPEC CPU results disclosed in public -- whether in writing or in verbal
form -- must adhere to the SPEC CPU Run and Reporting Rules, or be clearly described as estimates. </p>

<p class="snugbot">A published SPEC CPU2006 result is three things: </p>
<ol>
<li class="snug">A performance <a href="#obs">observation</a>; </li>
<li class="snug">A <a href="#decl">declaration</a> of expected performance; and </li>
<li class="snug">A claim about maturity of performance <a href="#opt">methods</a>.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="rule_1.2"><a name="obs" />1.2 A SPEC CPU2006 Result Is An Observation</h3>
<p>A published SPEC CPU2006 result is an empirical report of performance observed when carrying out certain computationally
intensive tasks.</p>

<h4 id="rule_1.2.1">1.2.1 Test Methods</h4>
<p>SPEC supplies the CPU2006 benchmarks in the form of source code, which testers are not allowed to modify except under
certain very restricted circumstances.  SPEC CPU2006 includes 29 benchmarks, organized into 2 suites: an integer suite of
12 benchmarks, known as CINT2006; and a floating point suite of 17 benchmarks, known as CFP2006.  </p>

<p style="margin-left:+2em"><b>Note:</b> this document avoids the (otherwise common) usage "CPU2006 suite" (singular),
instead insisting on "CPU2006 suites" (plural).  Thus a rule that requires consistency within a suite means that consistency
is required across the set of 12, or across the set of 17; not the set of 29.</p>

<p>
The tester supplies compilers and the System Under Test (SUT).  The tester may set
optimization flags and, where needed, portability flags, in a SPEC config file.  SPEC supplies tools which automatically:</p>
<ul>
  <li>archive the user-selected configuration file,</li>
  <li>generate Makefiles which are used to compile the benchmarks,</li>
  <li>run all the benchmarks in a suite (integer or floating point) in a single continuous run,</li>
  <li>validate each benchmark output to ensure that the benchmark generated acceptable outputs,</li>
  <li>pick the median of three runs for each benchmark, </li>
  <li>and compute metrics, such as SPECint2006 and SPECfp2006.</li>
</ul>

 <p>The CPU2006 benchmarks (code + workload) have been designed to fit within about 1GB of memory (when compiled with 32 bit pointers), i.e.
 within the capabilities of systems that allow user applications to use 32 bits (4GB).  </p>

    <p class="example">(SPEC is aware that some systems that are commonly described as "32-bit" may provide a smaller number
    of bits to user applications, for example if one or more bits are reserved to privileged code.  SPEC is also aware that
    there are many ways to spend profligate amounts of virtual memory.  Therefore, although 32-bit systems are within the design
    center for the CPU2006 suites, SPEC does not guarantee any particular memory size for the benchmarks, nor that they will
    necessarily fit on all systems that are described as 32-bit.) </p>

<h4 id="rule_1.2.2">1.2.2 Conditions of Observation</h4>
<p>The report that certain performance has been observed is meaningful only if the conditions of observation are stated.  SPEC therefore
requires that a published result include a description of all performance-relevant conditions. </p>

<h4 id="rule_1.2.3">1.2.3 Assumptions About the Tester</h4>
<p>It is assumed that the tester:</p>
<ul>
   <li>is willing to describe the observation and its conditions clearly;</li>
   <li>is able to learn how to operate the SUT in ways that comply with the rules in this document, for example by selecting
   compilation options that meet SPEC's requirements; </li>
   <li>knows the SUT better than those who have only indirect contact with it;</li>
   <li>is honest: SPEC CPU does not employ an independent auditor process, though it does have requirements for
   reproducibility and does encourage use of a peer review process.</li>
</ul>
<p>The person who actually carries out the test is, therefore, the first and the most important audience for these run rules.
The rules attempt to help the tester by trying to be clear about what is and what is not allowed.</p>

<h3 id="rule_1.3"><a name="decl" />1.3 A Published SPEC CPU2006 Result Is a Declaration of Expected Performance</h3>
<p>A published SPEC CPU2006 result is a declaration that the observed level of performance can be obtained by others.  Such
declarations are widely used by vendors in their marketing literature, and are expected to be meaningful to ordinary customers.</p>

<h4 id="rule_1.3.1">1.3.1 Reproducibility</h4>
<p>It is expected that later testers can obtain a copy of the SPEC CPU2006 suites, obtain the components described in the
original result, and reproduce the claimed performance, within a small range to allow for run-to-run variation.</p>

<h4 id="rule_1.3.2">1.3.2 Obtaining Components</h4>
<p>Therefore, it is expected that the components used in a published result can in fact be obtained, with the level of quality commonly
expected for products sold to ordinary customers.  Such components are required to:</p>
<ul>
   <li>be specified using customer-recognizable names,</li>
   <li>be generally available within certain time frames,</li>
   <li>provide documentation,</li>
   <li>provide an option for customer support,</li>
   <li>be of production quality, and</li>
   <li>provide a suitable environment for programming.</li>
</ul>

<p>The judgment of whether a component meets the above list may sometimes pose difficulty, and various references are given
in these rules to guidelines for such judgment.  But by way of introduction, imagine a vendor-internal version of a compiler,
designated only by an internal code name, unavailable to customers, which frequently generates incorrect code.  Such a
compiler would fail to provide a suitable environment for general programming, and would not be ready for use in a SPEC
CPU2006 result.</p>

<h3 id="rule_1.4"><a name="opt" />1.4 A SPEC CPU2006 Result is a Claim About Maturity of Performance Methods</h3>
<p>A published SPEC CPU result carries an implicit claim that the performance methods it employs are more than just
"prototype" or "experimental" or "research" methods; it is a claim that there is a certain level of maturity and general
applicability in its methods.  Unless clearly described as an estimate, a published SPEC result is a claim that the
performance methods employed (whether hardware or software, compiler or other):</p>
<ul>
   <li>Generate correct code for a class of programs larger than the SPEC CPU2006 suites,</li>
   <li>Improve performance for a class of programs larger than the SPEC CPU2006 suites,</li>
   <li>Are recommended by the vendor for a specified class of programs larger than the SPEC CPU2006 suites,</li>
   <li>Are generally available, documented, supported, and</li>
   <li>If used as part of <a href="#rule_2.2">base</a>, are <a href="#rule_2.2.1">safe</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>SPEC is aware of the importance of optimizations in producing the best performance.  SPEC is also aware that it is
sometimes hard to draw an exact line between legitimate optimizations that happen to benefit SPEC benchmarks, versus
optimizations that exclusively target the SPEC benchmarks.  However, with the list above, SPEC wants to increase awareness of
implementers and end users to issues of unwanted benchmark-specific optimizations that would be incompatible with SPEC's goal
of fair benchmarking. </p>

<p>The tester must describe the performance methods that are used in terms that a performance-aware user can follow, so that
users can understand how the performance was obtained and can determine whether the methods may be applicable to their own applications.
The tester must be able to make a credible public claim
that a class of applications in the real world may benefit from these methods. </p> 

<h3 id="rule_1.5">1.5 Peak and base builds </h3>

<p>"Peak" metrics may be produced by building each benchmark in the suite with a set of optimizations individually selected
for that benchmark. The optimizations selected must adhere to the set of general benchmark optimization rules described in
section 2.1 below. This may also be referred to as "aggressive compilation".</p>

<p>"Base" metrics must be produced by building all the benchmarks in the suite with a common set of optimizations.  In
addition to the general benchmark optimization rules (section 2.1), base optimizations must adhere to a stricter set of rules
described in section 2.2.  </p>

<p>These additional rules serve to form a "baseline" of performance that can be obtained with a single set of compiler
switches, single-pass make process, and a high degree of portability, safety, and performance.</p>

<ul> 
<li><p> The choice of a single set of switches and single-pass make process is intended to reflect the performance that
may be attained by a user who is interested in performance, but who prefers not to invest the time required for tuning of
individual programs, development of training workloads, and development of multi-pass Makefiles.</p></li>

<li><p>SPEC allows base builds to assume that the program follows the relevant language standard (i.e. it is portable).   But
this assumption may be made only where it does not interfere with getting the expected answer.  For all testing, SPEC
requires that benchmark outputs match an expected set of outputs, typically within a benchmark-defined tolerance to allow for
implementation differences among systems.</p>

<p>Because the SPEC CPU benchmarks are drawn from the compute intensive portion of real applications, some of them use
popular practices that compilers must commonly cater for, even if those practices are nonstandard.  In particular, some of
the programs (and, therefore, all of base) may have to be compiled with settings that do not exploit all optimization
possibilities that would be possible for programs with perfect standards compliance.</p></li>

<li><p>In base, the compiler may not make unsafe assumptions that are more aggressive than what the language standard
allows.</p></li>

<li><p>Finally, though, as a performance suite, SPEC CPU has throughout its history allowed certain common optimizations to
nevertheless be included in base, such as reordering of operands in accordance with algebraic identities.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Rules for building the benchmarks are described in section 2.</p>



<h3 id="rule_1.6">1.6 Estimates</h3>
<p>SPEC CPU2006 metrics may be estimated.  All <a href="#rule_4.8">estimates</a> must be clearly designated as such.</p>

<h3 id="rule_1.7">1.7 About SPEC</h3>
<h4 id="rule_1.7.1">1.7.1 Publication on SPEC's web site is encouraged</h4>

<p>SPEC encourages the review of CPU2006 results by the relevant subcommittee, and subsequent publication on SPEC's web
site (<a href="http://www.spec.org/cpu2006">http://www.spec.org/cpu2006</a>).  SPEC uses a peer-review process prior to publication, in
order to improve consistency in the understanding, application, and interpretation of these run rules.  </p>

<h4 id="rule_1.7.2">1.7.2 Publication on SPEC's web site is not required </h4>
<p>Review by SPEC is not required.  Testers may publish rule-compliant results independently.  No matter
where published, all results publicly disclosed must adhere to the SPEC Run and Reporting Rules, or be clearly marked as
estimates.  SPEC <a href="#rule_4.6">may take action</a> if the rules are not followed.</p>

<h4 id="rule_1.7.3">1.7.3 SPEC May Require New Tests</h4>
<p>In cases where it appears that the run rules have not been followed, SPEC may investigate such a claim and require that a
result be regenerated, or may require that the tester correct the deficiency (e.g. make the optimization more general purpose
or correct problems with code generation).</p>

<h4 id="rule_1.7.4">1.7.4 SPEC May Adapt the Suites</h4>
<p>The SPEC Open Systems Group reserves the right to adapt the SPEC CPU2006 suites as it deems necessary to preserve its goal
of fair benchmarking.  Such adaptations might include (but are not limited to) removing benchmarks, modifying codes or
workloads, adapting metrics, republishing old results adapted to a new metric, or requiring retesting by the original
tester.</p>

<h3 id="rule_1.8">1.8 Usage of the Philosophy Section</h3>
<p>This philosophy section is intended to introduce concepts of fair benchmarking.  It is understood that in some cases, this
section uses terms that may require judgment, or which may lack specificity.  For more specific requirements, please see the
sections below.</p>

<p>In case of a conflict between this philosophy section and a run rule in one of the sections below, normally the run rule found 
below takes priority.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, there are several conditions under which questions should be resolved by reference to this section: (a)
self-conflict: if rules below are found to impose incompatible requirements; (b) ambiguity: if they are unclear or
silent with respect to a question that affects how a result is obtained, published, or interpreted; (c) obsolecsence: if the
rules below  are made obsolete by changing technical circumstances or by directives from superior entities within
SPEC.</p>

<p>When questions arise as to interpretation of the run rules:</p>
<ol>
   <li><p> Interested parties should seek first to resolve questions based on the rules as written in the sections that
   follow.  If this is not practical (because of problems of contradiction, ambiguity, or obsolescence), then the principles
   of the philosophy section should be used to resolve the issue.</p></li>
   <li><p> The SPEC CPU subcommittee should be notified of the issue.  Contact information may be found via the SPEC web site,
   www.spec.org.</p></li>
   <li><p>SPEC may choose to issue a ruling on the issue at hand, and may choose to amend the rules to avoid future such
   issues.</p></li>
</ol>


<h2 id="rule_2.0">2.0 Building SPEC CPU2006</h2>

<p>SPEC has adopted a set of rules defining how SPEC CPU2006 benchmark suites must be built and run to produce peak and base
metrics. </p>

<h4 id="rule_2.0.1">2.0.1 Base and Peak Builds </h4>

<p>(This rule, formerly present in CPU2000, is now covered in <a href="#rule_1.5">section 1.5</a>.) </p>

<h4 id="rule_2.0.2">2.0.2 SPEC's tools must be used</h4>

<p>With the release of SPEC CPU2006 suites, a set of tools based on GNU Make and Perl5 are supplied to build and run the
benchmarks.  To produce publication-quality results, these SPEC tools must be used.  This helps ensure reproducibility of
results by requiring that all individual benchmarks in the suites are run in the same way and that a configuration file is
available that defines the optimizations used. </p>

<p>The primary tool is called <tt>runspec</tt> (<tt>runspec.bat</tt> for
Microsoft Windows). It is described in the <tt>runspec</tt> documentation in the
<tt>Docs</tt> subdirectory of the SPEC root directory -- in a Bourne shell
that would be called <tt>${SPEC}/Docs/</tt>, or on Microsoft Windows 
<tt>%SPEC%\Docs\</tt>.</p>

<p>Some Fortran programs in the floating point suite need to be preprocessed, for example to choose variable sizes depending on whether
-DSPEC_CPU_LP64 has been set.  Fortran preprocessing must be done using the SPEC-supplied preprocessor, even if the vendor's
compiler has its own preprocessor.  <tt>Runspec</tt> will automatically enforce this requirement by invoking the SPEC
preprocessor.</p>

<p>SPEC supplies pre-compiled versions of the tools for a variety of platforms.  If a new platform is used, please see
<tt>tools-build.html</tt> in the Docs directories for information on how to build the tools, and how to obtain approval for
them.  SPEC's approval is required for the tool build, so a log must be generated during the build.</p>

<p>For more complex ways of compilation, for example feedback-driven compilation, SPEC has provided hooks in the tools so
that such compilation and execution is possible (see the tools documentation for details).  Only if, unexpectedly, such a
compilation and execution should not be possible, there is the possibility that the tester may ask for permission to
use performance-neutral alternatives (see <a href="#rule_5">section&nbsp;5</a>).</p>

<h4 id="rule_2.0.3">2.0.3 The runspec build environment </h4>

<p>When <tt>runspec</tt> is used to build the SPEC CPU2006 benchmarks, it must be used in generally available, documented,
and supported environments (see <a href="#rule_1">section&nbsp;1</a>), and any aspects of the environment that contribute to
performance must be disclosed to SPEC (see <a href="#rule_4">section&nbsp;4</a>).  </p>

<p>On occasion, it may be possible to improve run time performance by environmental choices at build time.  For example, one
might install a performance monitor, turn on an operating system feature such as bigpages, or set an environment variable
that causes the <tt>cc</tt> driver to invoke a faster version of the linker.</p>

<p>It is difficult to draw a precise line between environment settings that are reasonable versus settings that are not.
Some settings are obviously not relevant to performance (such as hostname), and SPEC makes no attempt to regulate such
settings.  But for settings that do have a performance effect, for the sake of clarity, SPEC has chosen that: </p>

<ul>
   <li><p>(a) The tester may install whatever software the tester wishes, including performance-enhancing software, but such
   software must be installed prior to starting the builds, must remain installed throughout the builds, and must be
   documented, supported, generally available, and disclosed to SPEC.</p></li>

   <li><p>(b) The tester may set whatever system configuration parameters the tester wishes, but these must be applied at
   boot time, documented, supported, generally available, and disclosed to SPEC. "Dynamic" system parameters (i.e. ones that
   do not require a reboot) must nevertheless be applied at boot time, except as provided under <a
   href="#rule_2.0.5">section&nbsp;2.0.5</a>.</p></li>

   <li><p>(c) After the boot process is completed, environment settings may be made as follows:
      <br />* to specify resource limits (for example, as in the Bourne shell <tt>ulimit</tt> command), and
      <br />* to select major components of the compilation system -- for example, as in:</p>
         <p class="codeexample">
         setenv CC_LOC /net/dist/version73/cc
         <br />setenv LD_LOC /net/opt/dist/ld-fast</p>
      <p>-- but these settings must be documented; supported; generally available; disclosed to SPEC; made PRIOR to starting
      the build; and must not change during the build, except as provided in 
      <a href="#rule_2.0.5" >section 2.0.5</a>.</p></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="rule_2.0.4">2.0.4 Continuous Build requirement</h4>

<p>As described in <a href="#rule_1">section&nbsp;1</a>, it is expected that testers can reproduce other testers' results.
In particular, it must be possible for a new tester to compile both the base and peak benchmarks for an entire suite (i.e.
CINT2006 or CFP2006) in one execution of <tt>runspec</tt>, with appropriate command line arguments and an appropriate
configuration file, and obtain executable binaries that are (from a performance point of view) equivalent to the binaries
used by the original tester.</p>

<p>The simplest and least error-prone way to meet this requirement is for the original tester to take production hardware,
production software, a SPEC config file, and the SPEC tools and actually build the benchmarks in a single invocation of
<tt>runspec</tt> on the System Under Test (SUT).  But SPEC realizes that there is a cost to benchmarking and would like to
address this, for example through the rules that follow regarding cross-compilation and individual builds.  However, in all
cases, the tester is taken to assert that the compiled executables will exhibit the same performance as if they all had been
compiled with a single invocation of <tt>runspec</tt> (see <a href="#rule_2.0.8">2.0.8)</a>.</p>

<h4 id="rule_2.0.5">2.0.5 Changes to the runspec build environment </h4>

<p>SPEC CPU2006 base binaries must be built using the environment rules of <a href="#rule_2.0.3">section&nbsp;2.0.3</a>, and
must not rely upon any changes to the environment during the build.  </p>

<p><i><b>Note 1:</b> base cross compiles using multiple hosts are allowed (<a href="#rule_2.0.6">2.0.6</a>), but the
performance of the resulting binaries must not depend upon environmental differences among the hosts.  It must be possible to
build performance-equivalent base binaries with one set of switches (<a href="#rule_2.2.2">2.2.2</a>), in one execution of
<tt>runspec</tt> (<a href="#rule_2.0.4">2.0.4</a>), on one host, with one environment (<a href="#rule_2.0.3">2.0.3</a>).
</i></p>

<p>For a peak build, the environment may be changed, subject to the following constraints:</p>
<ul>
   <li><p>The environment change must be accomplished using the SPEC-provided config file hooks (such as
   <tt>fdo_pre0</tt>).</p></li>

   <li><p>The environment change must be fully disclosed to SPEC (see <a href="#rule_4">section&nbsp;4</a>).</p></li>

   <li><p>The environment change must not be incompatible with a Continuous Build (see <a
   href="#rule_2.0.4">section&nbsp;2.0.4</a>).</p></li>

   <li><p>The environment change must be accomplished using simple shell commands.  It is not permitted to invoke a more
   complex entity unless that entity is provided as part of a generally-available software package.  </p>

        <p class="example" style="margin-bottom:0cm" >Examples: </p>
        <ul>
        <li class="example">Allowed: simple shell commands such as <tt>/usr/opt/performance_monitor -start</tt>, or
        <tt>setenv BIGPAGES YES</tt>.</li>

        <li class="example">Not allowed: a shell script, batch file, <tt>kdbx</tt> script, or Microsoft Windows  registry
        adjustment program (unless provided as part of a generally-available software package).  </li>

        <li class="example">Allowed: a script that is provided as part of the OS, and which uses <tt>kdbx</tt> to adjust the
        setting of <tt>bigpages</tt></li>

        <li class="example">Not allowed: a <tt>kdbx</tt> script specially written by the tester just for SPEC.</li>

        </ul>

   </li>

</ul>

<p><i><b>Note 2</b>: peak cross compiles using multiple hosts are allowed (<a href="#rule_2.0.6">2.0.6</a>), but the
performance of the resulting binaries must not depend upon environmental differences among the hosts.  It must be possible to
build performance-equivalent peak binaries with one config file, in one execution of <tt>runspec</tt> (<a
href="#rule_2.0.4">2.0.4</a>), in the same execution of <tt>runspec</tt> that built the base binaries, on one host, starting
from the environment used for the base build (<a href="#rule_2.0.3">2.0.3</a>), and changing that environment only through
config file hooks (<a href="#rule_2.0.5">2.0.5</a>).  </i></p>

<h4 id="rule_2.0.6">2.0.6 Cross-compilation allowed </h4>

<p>It is permitted to use cross-compilation, that is, a building process where the benchmark executables are built on a
system (or systems) that differ(s) from the SUT.  The <tt>runspec</tt> tool must be used on all systems (typically with <tt
style="white-space:nowrap;">-a build</tt> on the host(s) and <tt style="white-space:nowrap;">-a validate</tt> on the
SUT).</p>

<p>If all systems belong to the same product family and if the software used to build the executables is available on all
systems, this does not need to be documented.  In the case of a true cross compilation, (e.g. if the software used to build
the benchmark executables is not available on the SUT, or the host system provides performance gains via specialized tuning
or hardware not on the SUT), the host system(s) and software used for the benchmark building process must be documented in
the Notes section.  See <a href="#rule_4">section&nbsp;4</a>.</p>

<p>It is permitted to use more than one host in a cross-compilation. If more than one host is used in a cross-compilation,
they must be sufficiently equivalent so as not to violate rule <a href="#rule_2.0.4">2.0.4</a>.  That is, it must be possible
to build the entire suite on a single host and obtain binaries that are equivalent to the binaries produced using multiple
hosts.  </p>

<p>The purpose of allowing multiple hosts is so that testers can save time when recompiling many programs.  Multiple hosts
must NOT be used in order to gain performance advantages due to environmental differences among the hosts.  In fact, the
tester must exercise great care to ensure that any environment differences are performance neutral among the hosts, for
example by ensuring that each has the same version of the operating system, the same performance software, the same
compilers, and the same libraries.  The tester must exercise due diligence to ensure that differences that appear to be
performance neutral - such as differing MHz or differing memory amounts on the build hosts - are in fact truly neutral.</p>

<p>Multiple hosts must NOT be used in order to work around system or compiler incompatibilities (e.g. compiling the
SPECfp2006 C benchmarks on a different OS version than the SPECfp2006 Fortran benchmarks in order to meet the different
compilers' respective OS requirements), since that would violate the Continuous Build rule (<a
href="#rule_2.0.4">2.0.4</a>).</p>

<h4 id="rule_2.0.7">2.0.7 Individual builds allowed</h4>

<p>It is permitted to build the benchmarks with multiple invocations of <tt>runspec</tt>, for example during a tuning effort.
But, the executables must be built using a consistent set of software.  If a change to the software environment is introduced
(for example, installing a new version of the C compiler which is expected to improve the performance of one of the floating
point benchmarks), then all affected benchmarks must be rebuilt (in this example, all the C benchmarks in the floating point
suite). </p>

<h4 id="rule_2.0.8">2.0.8 Tester's assertion of equivalence between build types </h4>

<p>The previous 4 rules may appear to contradict each other (<a href="#rule_2.0.4">2.0.4</a> through <a
href="#rule_2.0.7">2.0.7</a>), but the key word in <a href="#rule_2.0.4">2.0.4</a> is the word "possible".</p>

<p class="example">Consider the following sequence of events:</p>

<ul>
   <li class="example">A tester has built a complete set of CPU2006 executable images ("binaries") on her usual host system.  </li>

   <li class="example">A hot new SUT arrives for a limited period of time.  It has no compilers installed.</li>

   <li class="example">A SPEC CPU2006 tree is installed on the SUT, along with the binaries and config file generated on the
   usual host.</li>

   <li class="example">It is learned that performance could be improved if the peak version of <tt>999.sluggard</tt> were
   compiled with <tt>-O5</tt> instead of <tt>-O4</tt>.  </li>

   <li class="example">On the host system, the tester edits the config file to change to <tt>-O5</tt> for
   <tt>999.sluggard</tt>, and issues the command: <br /><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;runspec -c myconfig -D -a
   build -T peak sluggard</tt></li>

   <li class="example">The tester copies the new binary and config file to the SUT</li>

   <li class="example">A complete run is started by issuing the command:
        <br /><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;runspec -c myconfig -a validate all</tt></li>

    <li class="example">Performance is as expected, and the results are published at SPEC (including the config file).</li>
</ul>

<p class="example">In this example, the tester is taken to be asserting that the above sequence of events produces binaries
that are, from a performance point of view, equivalent to binaries that it would have been possible to build in a single
invocation of the tools.</p>  

<p>If there is some optimization that can only be applied to individual benchmark builds, but which it is not possible to
apply in a continuous build, the optimization must not be used.</p>

<p>Rule <a href="#rule_2.0.8">2.0.8</a> is intended to provide some guidance about the kinds of practices that are
reasonable, but the ultimate responsibility for result reproducibility lies with the tester.  If the tester is uncertain
whether a cross-compile or an individual benchmark build is equivalent to a full build on the SUT, then a full build on the
SUT is required (or, in the case of a true cross-compile which is documented as such, then a single <tt>runspec -a build</tt>
is required on a single host.)  Although full builds add to the cost of benchmarking, in some instances a full build in a
single <tt>runspec</tt> may be the only way to ensure that results will be reproducible.</p>


<h3 id="rule_2.1">2.1 General Rules for Selecting Compilation Flags </h3>

<p>The following rules apply to compiler flag selection for SPEC CPU2006 Peak and Base Metrics.  Additional rules for Base
Metrics follow in <a href="#rule_2.2">section&nbsp;2.2</a>. </p>

<h4 id="rule_2.1.1">2.1.1 Must not use names</h4>

<p>Source file or variable or subroutine names must not be used within optimization flags or compiler/build options.  </p>

<p>Identifiers used in preprocessor directives to select alternative source code are also forbidden, except for a
rule-compliant library substitution (<a href="#rule_2.1.2">2.1.2</a>) or an approved portability flag (<a
href="#rule_2.1.5">2.1.5</a>).</p>

<p class="snugbot">For example, if a benchmark source code uses one of:</p>
<pre>
        #ifdef IDENTIFIER 
        #ifndef IDENTIFIER 
        #if defined IDENTIFIER
        #if !defined IDENTIFIER
</pre>

<p class="snugtop">to provide alternative source code under the control of a compiler option such as <tt>-DIDENTIFIER</tt>,
such a switch may not be used unless it meets the criteria of 2.1.2 or 2.1.5.</p>

<h4 id="rule_2.1.2">2.1.2  Limitations on library substitutions</h4>

<p>Flags which substitute pre-computed (e.g. library-based) routines for routines defined in the benchmark on the basis of
the routine's name must not be used.  Exceptions are:</p>

<p>a) the function <tt>alloca</tt>.  It is permitted to use a flag that substitutes the system's <tt>builtin_alloca</tt>.
Such a flag may be applied to individual benchmarks (in both base and peak).</p>

<p>b) the level 1, 2 and 3 BLAS functions in the CFP2006 benchmarks, and the netlib-interface-compliant FFT functions.  Such
substitution may be used in a peak run, but must not be used in base.</p>

<p>Note: rule 2.1.2 does not forbid flags that select alternative implementations of library functions defined in an ANSI/ISO
language standard.  For example, such flags might select an optimized library of these functions, or allow them to be
inlined.  </p>

<h4 id="rule_2.1.3">2.1.3  Feedback directed optimization is allowed in peak.  </h4>

<p>Feedback directed optimization may be used in peak.  Only the training input (which is automatically selected by
<tt>runspec</tt>) may be used for the run(s) that generate(s) feedback data.  </p>

<p>Optimization with multiple feedback runs is also allowed (build, run, build, run, build...).</p>

<p>The requirement to use only the train data set at compile time shall not be taken to forbid the use of run-time dynamic
optimization tools that would observe the reference execution and dynamically modify the in-memory copy of the benchmark.
However, such tools must not in any way affect later executions of the same benchmark (for example, when running multiple
times in order to determine the median run time).   Such tools must also be disclosed in the publication of a result, and must
be used for the entire suite (see <a href="#rule_3.3">section&nbsp;3.3</a>).</p>

<h4 id="rule_2.1.4">2.1.4 Limitations on size changes</h4>

<p>Flags that change a data type size to a size different from the default
size of the compilation system are not allowed.  Exceptions are: a) the C long type may be set to 32 or greater bits; b)
pointer sizes may be set in a manner which requires, or which assumes, that the benchmarks (code+data) fit into 32
bits of address space.</p>

<h4 id="rule_2.1.5">2.1.5 Portability Flags </h4>

<p>Rule <a href="#rule_2.2.2">2.2.2</a> requires that all benchmarks use the same flags in base.  <i>Portability flags</i> are
an exception to this rule: they may differ from one benchmark to another, even in base.  Such flags are subject to two major
requirements:</p>

<ol>
<li>They must be used via the provided config file PORTABILITY lines
    (such as <tt>CPORTABILITY</tt>, 
    <tt>FPORTABILITY</tt>, etc).  </li>

<li>They must be approved by the SPEC CPU Subcommittee.</li>
</ol>

<p>The initial published results for CPU2006 will include a reviewed set of portability flags on several operating systems;
later users who propose to apply additional portability flags must prepare a justification for their use.  </p>

<p>A proposed portability flag will normally be approved if one of the following conditions holds:</p>

<ul>
   <li><p>(a) The flag selects a performance-neutral alternate benchmark source, and the benchmark cannot build and execute
   correctly on the given platform unless the alternate source is selected.  (Examples might be flags such as
   <tt>-DHOST_WORDS_BIG_ENDIAN</tt>, <tt>-DHAVE_SIGNED_CHAR</tt>.)</p></li>

   <li><p>(b) The flag selects a compiler mode that allows basic parsing of the input source program, and it is not possible
   to set that flag for all programs of the given language in the suite.  (An example might be <tt>-fixedform</tt>, to select
   Fortran source code fixed format.)</p></li>

   <li><p>(c) The flag selects features from a certain version of the language, and it is not possible to set that flag for
   all programs of the given language in the suite.  (An example might be <tt>-language:c89</tt>.)</p></li>

   <li><p>(d) The flag solves a data model problem, as described in section <a href="#rule_2.2.9">2.2.9</a>.</p></li>

   <li><p>(e) The flag selects a resource limit, and it is not possible to set that flag for all programs of the given
   language in the suite.  </p></li>

</ul>

<p>A proposed portability flag will normally not be approved unless it is essential in order to successfully build and run
the benchmark.  </p>

<p>If more than one solution can be used for a problem, the subcommittee will review attributes such as precedent from
previously published results, performance neutrality, standards compliance, amount of code affected, impact on the expressed original
intent of the program, and good coding practices (in rough order of priority).</p>

<p>If a benchmark is discovered to violate the relevant standard, that may or may not be reason for the subcommittee to grant
a portability flag.  If the justification for a portability flag is standards compliance, the tester must include a
specific reference to the offending source code module and line number, and a specific reference to the relevant sections of
the appropriate standard.  The tester should also address impact on the other attributes mentioned in the previous
paragraph.</p>

<p>If a given portability problem (within a given language) occurs in multiple places within a suite, then,
in base, the same method(s) must be applied to solve all instances of the problem.</p>

<p>If a library is specified as a portability flag, SPEC may request that the table of contents of the library be included in
the disclosure.</p>


<h3 id="rule_2.2">2.2 Base Optimization Rules</h3>

<p>In addition to the rules listed in <a href="#rule_2.1">section&nbsp;2.1</a> above, the selection of optimizations to be
used to produce SPEC CPU2006 Base Metrics includes the following: </p>

<h4 id="rule_2.2.1">2.2.1  Safety and Standards Conformance</h4>

<p>The optimizations used are expected to be safe, and it is expected that system or compiler vendors would endorse
the general use of these optimizations by customers who seek to achieve good application performance.</p>

<p>The requirements that optimizations be safe, and that they generate correct code for a class of programs larger than the
suites themselves (rule <a href="#rule_1.4">1.4</a>), are normally interpreted as requiring that the system, as used in base,
implement the language correctly.  "The language" is defined by the appropriate ANSI/ISO standard (C99, Fortran-95, C++
98).</p>

<p>The principle of standards conformance is not automatically applied, because SPEC has historically allowed certain
exceptions:</p>
<ol>
   <li><a href="#rule_2.2.5">Section 2.2.5</a> allows reordering of arithmetic operands.</li>
   <li>SPEC has not insisted on conformance to the C standard in the setting of <tt>errno</tt>.</li>
   <li>SPEC has not dealt with (and does not intend to deal with) language standard violations that are performance neutral
   for the CPU2006 suites.</li>
   <li>When a more recent language standard modifies a requirement imposed by an earlier standard, SPEC will also accept
   systems that adhere to the more recent ANSI/ISO language standard.</li>
</ol>

<p>Otherwise, a deviation from the standard that is not performance neutral, and gives the particular implementation a
CPU2006 performance advantage over standard-conforming implementations, is considered an indication that the requirements
about "safe" and "correct code" optimizations are probably not met.  Such a deviation may be a reason for SPEC to find a
result not rule-conforming.</p>

<p>If an optimization causes any SPEC CPU2006 benchmark to fail to validate, and if the relevant portion of this benchmark's
code is within the language standard, the failure is taken as additional evidence that an optimization is not safe.</p>

<p><b>Regarding C++:</b> Note that for C++ applications, the standard calls for support of both run-time type information
(RTTI) and exception handling.  The compiler, as used in base, must enable these.  </p>

   <p class="example">For example, a compiler enables exception handling by default; it can be turned off with <tt
   style="white-space:nowrap;">--noexcept</tt>.  The switch <tt style="white-space:nowrap;">--noexcept</tt> is not allowed in
   base.</p>

   <p class="example">For example, a compiler defaults to no run time type information, but allows it to be turned on via <tt
   style="white-space:nowrap;">--rtti</tt>.  The switch <tt style="white-space:nowrap;">--rtti</tt> must be used in base.</p>


<p><b>Regarding accuracy: </b>Because language standards generally do not set specific requirements for accuracy, SPEC has
also chosen not to do so.  Nevertheless:</p>

<ul>   
   <li> Optimizations are expected to generate code that provides appropriate accuracy for a class of problems, where that
   class is larger than the SPEC benchmarks themselves.</li>
   <li> Implementations are encouraged to clearly document any accuracy limitations.</li>
   <li> Implementations are encouraged to adhere to the principle of "no surprises"; this can be achieved both by predictable
   algorithms and by documentation.</li>
</ul>

<p>In cases where the class of appropriate applications appears to be so narrowly drawn as to constitute a "benchmark special",
that may be a reason for SPEC to find a result non-conforming.</p>

<h4 id="rule_2.2.2">2.2.2  Same for all </h4>

<p>In base, the same compiler must be used for all modules of a given language within a benchmark suite.  Except for
portability flags (see <a href="#rule_2.1.5">2.1.5</a> above), all flags or options that affect the transformation process
from SPEC-supplied source to completed executable must be the same, including but not limited to:</p>

<ul>
   <li>compiler options</li>
   <li>linker options</li>
   <li>preprocessor options</li>
   <li>libraries</li>
   <li>flags that set warning levels (typically <tt>-w</tt>), </li>
   <li>flags that create object files (typically <tt>-c</tt>, <tt>-o</tt>), </li>
   <li>flags that affect the verbosity level of the compiler driver (typically <tt>-v</tt>)</li>
   <li>language dialect selection switches (e.g. <tt>-ansi99</tt>, <tt>-std</tt>)</li>
   <li>flags that assert standards compliance by the benchmarks (see <a href="#rule_2.2.4">2.2.4</a>, below)</li>
   <li>flags that are set at installation time</li>
   <li>flags that are set on a system-global basis</li>
</ul>

<p>All flags must be applied in the same order for all compiles of a given language.</p>

<p class="snugbot">Note that the SPEC tools provide methods to set flags on a per-language basis.  </p>
<p class="example">For example, if a tester sets:</p>
<p class="codeexample">fp=base:<br />
                     COPTIMIZE = -O4<br />
                     FOPTIMIZE = -O5</p>
<p class="example">then the floating point C benchmarks will be compiled with <tt>-O4</tt> and the floating point Fortran
benchmarks with <tt>-O5</tt>.  (This is legal: there is no requirement to compile C with the same optimization level as
Fortran.)</p>

<p><b>Regarding benchmarks that have been written in more than one language:</b>  </p>

<p class="snugbot">In a mixed-language benchmark, the tools automatically compile each source module with the
options that have been set for its language.</p>
<p class="example">Continuing the example just above, a benchmark that uses both C and Fortran would have its C modules
compiled with <tt>-O4</tt> and its Fortran modules with <tt>-O5</tt>.  This, too, is legal.</p>

<p>In order to link an executable for a mixed-language benchmark, the tools need to decide which link options to apply (e.g.
those defined in <tt>CLD</tt>/<tt>CLDOPT</tt> vs. those in <tt>FLD</tt>/<tt>FLDOPT</tt> vs. those in
<tt>CXXLD</tt>/<tt>CXXLDOPT</tt>).  This decision is based on benchmark classifications that were determined during
development of CPU2006.  

For reasons of link time library inclusion, the classifications were not made based on percentage of code nor on
the language of the main routine; rather, the classifications have been set to either <tt>F</tt> (for mixed
Fortran/C benchmarks) or <tt>CXX</tt> (for benchmarks that include C++).</p>
 
<!-- Note: for the pargraph that follows, in the face-to-face discussion 10 aug 2005, it was considered important to have the
example in sentence two located up tight against the first sentence; the paragraph should not be broken into two.  -->
<p>Link options must be consistent in a base build.  For example, if FLD is set to <tt>/usr/opt/advanced/ld</tt> for pure
Fortran benchmarks, the same setting must be used for any mixed language benchmarks that have been classified, for purpose of
linking, as Fortran.  </p>

<p><b>Inter-module optimization and mixed-language benchmarks:</b></p>

<p class="snugbot">For mixed-language benchmarks, if the compilers have an incompatible inter-module optimization format,
flags that require inter-module format compatibility may be dropped from base optimization of mixed-language benchmarks.
The same flags must be dropped from all benchmarks that use the same combination of languages.  All other base
optimization flags for a given language must be retained for the modules of that language.  </p>

<p class="example">For example, suppose that a suite has exactly two benchmarks that employ both C and Fortran, namely
<tt>997.CFmix1</tt> and <tt>998.CFmix2</tt>.  A tester uses a C compiler and Fortran compiler that are sufficiently
compatible to be able to allow their object modules to be linked together - but not sufficiently compatible to allow
inter-module optimization.  The C compiler spells its intermodule optimization switch <tt>-ifo</tt>, and the Fortran compiler
spells its switch <tt>--intermodule_optimize</tt>.  In this case, the following would be legal:</p>
<p class="codeexample">fp=base:<br />
   COPTIMIZE = -fast -O4 -ur=8 -ifo<br />
   FOPTIMIZE = --prefetch:all --optimize:5 --intermodule_optimize<br />
   FLD=/usr/opt/advanced/ld<br />
   FLDOPT=--nocompress --lazyload --intermodule_optimize<br />
   <br />
   997.CFmix1,998.CFmix2=base:<br />
   COPTIMIZE = -fast -O4 -ur=8 <br />
   FOPTIMIZE = --prefetch:all --optimize:5 <br />
   FLD=/usr/opt/advanced/ld<br />
   FLDOPT=--nocompress --lazyload</p>
<p class="example">Following the precedence rules as explained in <a href="config.html">config.html</a>, the above section
specifiers set default tuning for the C and Fortran benchmarks in the floating point suite, but the tuning is modified 
for the two mixed-language benchmarks to remove switches that would have attempted inter-module optimization.</p>



<h4 id="rule_2.2.3">2.2.3   Feedback directed optimization must not be used in base.  </h4>

<p>Feedback directed optimization must not be used in base for SPEC CPU2006.  (This is a change from SPEC CPU2000.)</p>

<h4 id="rule_2.2.4">2.2.4  Assertion flags must NOT be used in base.  </h4>

<p>An assertion flag is one that supplies semantic information that the compilation system did not derive from the source
statements of the benchmark.</p>

<p>With an assertion flag, the programmer asserts to the compiler that the program has certain nice properties that allow the
compiler to apply more aggressive optimization techniques (for example, that there is no aliasing via C pointers).  The
problem is that there can be legal programs (possibly strange, but still standard-conforming programs) where such a property
does not hold.  These programs could crash or give incorrect results if an assertion flag is used.  This is the reason why
such flags are sometimes also called "unsafe flags".  Assertion flags should never be applied to a production program without
previous careful checks; therefore they must not be used for base.  </p>

<p>Exception: a tester is free to turn on a flag that asserts that the benchmark source code complies to the relevant
standard (e.g. <tt>-ansi_alias</tt>).  Note, however, that if such a flag is used, it must be applied to all compiles of the
given language (C, C++, or Fortran), while still passing SPEC's validation tools with correct answers for all the affected
programs.</p>

<h4 id="rule_2.2.5">2.2.5  Floating point reordering allowed</h4>

<p>Base results may use flags which affect the numerical accuracy or sensitivity by reordering floating-point operations
based on algebraic identities. </p>

<h4 id="rule_2.2.6">2.2.6  (removed) </h4>

<p>(This rule, formerly present in CPU2000, has been removed for CPU2006.)</p>


<h4 id="rule_2.2.7">2.2.7 Safety and Standards Conformance</h4>

<p>This rule, formerly present in CPU2000, has been merged into rule <a href="#rule_2.2.1">2.2.1</a> for CPU2006.</p>

<h4 id="rule_2.2.8">2.2.8 Base build environment</h4>

<p>The system environment must not be manipulated during a build of base.  For example, suppose that an environment variable
called <tt>bigpages</tt> can be set to <tt>yes</tt> or <tt>no</tt>, and the default is <tt>no</tt>.  The tester must not
change the choice during the build of the base binaries.  See <a href="#rule_2.0.5">section&nbsp;2.0.5</a>.</p>


<h4 id="rule_2.2.9">2.2.9 Portability Switches for Data Models</h4>

<p>Normally, it is expected that the data model (such as pointer sizes, sizes of int, etc) will be consistent in base 
for all compilation of a given language.  In particular, several benchmarks use -DSPEC_CPU_LP64, -DSPEC_CPU_P64, and/or 
-DSPEC_CPU_ILP64 to control the data model.  If one of these flags is used in base, then normally it should be set for 
all benchmarks of the given language in the suite for base. </p>
 
<p>If for some reason it is not practical to use a consistent data model in base, then SPEC may choose to grant a 
portability flag and allow use of an inconsistent data model in base. </p>

<p class="example">(i) For example, suppose that it is preferable to use a certain system in 64-bit mode, but that a
benchmark is found, unexpectedly, to have a source code limitation that prevents such usage.</p>  

<p class="example">(ii) For example, suppose that a certain compiler combination runs into data model difficulties due to the
presence of mixed-language benchmarks in a suite.</p>

<p>The tester could describe the problem to SPEC and request that SPEC allow
use of an inconsistent data model in base.  SPEC would consider such a request using the same process outlined in <a
href="#rule_2.1.5">rule 2.1.5</a>, including consideration of the technical arguments as to the nature of the data model
problem and consideration of the practicality of technical alternatives, if any.  SPEC might or might not grant the
portability flag.  SPEC might also choose to fix source code limitations, if any,  that are causing difficulty.</p> 


<h4 id="rule_2.2.10">2.2.10 Cross-module optimization</h4>

<p>Frequently, performance may be improved via optimizations that work across source modules, for example <tt>-ifo</tt>,
<tt>-xcrossfile</tt>, or <tt>-IPA</tt>.  Some compilers may require the simultaneous presentation of all source files for
inter-file optimization, as in:</p>

<p class="codeexample">cc -ifo -o a.out file1.c file2.c</p>

<p>Other compilers may be able to do cross-module optimization even with separate compilation, as in:</p>

<p class="codeexample">cc -ifo -c -o file1.o file1.c
<br />cc -ifo -c -o file2.o file2.c
<br />cc -ifo -o a.out file1.o file2.o
</p>

<p>By default, the SPEC tools operate in the latter mode, but they can be switched to the former through the config file
option <tt>ONESTEP=yes</tt>.</p>

<p>ONESTEP is not allowed in base.  (This is a change from CPU2000.)</p>

<h4 id="rule_2.2.11">2.2.11 Alignment switches are allowed </h4>

<p>Switches that cause data to be aligned on natural boundaries may be used in base. </p>

<h4 id="rule_2.2.12">2.2.12 Pointer sizes</h4>
<p>In base, pointer sizes may be set in a manner which requires, or which assumes, that the benchmarks (code+data) fit into 32
bits of address space.</p> 

<h2 id="rule_3">3. Running SPEC CPU2006</h2>

<h3 id="rule_3.1">3.1 System Configuration  </h3>

<h4 id="rule_3.1.1">3.1.1   File Systems </h4>

<p>SPEC requires the use of a of single file system to contain the directory tree for the SPEC CPU2006 suite being run.  SPEC
allows any type of file system (disk-based, memory-based, NFS, DFS, FAT, NTFS etc.) to be used.  The type of file system must
be disclosed in reported results. </p>

   <p>There is a  config file feature that allows a user to define a directory 
     tree to hold the run directories (along with some other outputs; please 
     see the discussion of <a href="config.html#output_root">output_root in config.html</a>).  This 
     feature  may be used in a reportable run.  If it is used,</p>
   <ul>
      <li> The directory tree that contains the run directories is not required to be on the same file system as 
         the installed SPEC CPU2006 tree.</li>
      <li> A single file system must contain the directory tree that contains the run directories.</li>
   </ul>

<h4 id="rule_3.1.2">3.1.2   System State </h4>

<p>The system state (multi-user, single-user, init level N) may be selected by the tester.  This state along with any changes in
the default configuration of daemon processes or system tuning parameters must be documented in the notes section of the
results disclosure.  (For Microsoft Windows, system state is normally "Default"; a list of services that are shut down
should be provided, if any, e.g.  networking service shut down) </p>

<h3 id="rule_3.2">3.2 Additional Rules for Running SPECrate </h3>

<h4 id="rule_3.2.1">3.2.1  Number of copies in peak</h4>

<p>For SPECint_rate2006 and SPECfp_rate2006 (peak), the tester is free to choose the number of concurrent copies for each
individual benchmark independently of the other benchmarks. </p>

<p>The median value that is used must, for each benchmark, come from three runs with the same number of copies.
However, this number may be different between benchmarks.</p>

<h4 id="rule_3.2.2">3.2.2  Number of copies in base</h4>

<p>For SPECint_rate_base2006 and SPECfp_rate_base2006, the tester must select a single value to use as the number of concurrent
copies to be applied to all benchmarks in the suite.</p>

<h4 id="rule_3.2.3">3.2.3  Single file system</h4>

<p>The multiple concurrent copies of the benchmark must be executed using data from different directories within the same file
system.  Each copy of the test must have its own working directory, which must contain all the input files needed for the
actual execution of the benchmark, and all output files when created.  The output of each copy of the benchmark must be
validated to be the correct output. </p>

<p>Note: although benchmark inputs are duplicated across run directories, the benchmark binary itself is only placed into the
run directories once. </p> 

<h4 id="rule_3.2.4">3.2.4  Submit</h4>

<p>The config file option <tt>submit</tt> may be used to assign work to processors.  It is commonly used for SPECrate runs,
but can also be used for the non-rate ("speed") case.  The tester may, if desired: </p>

<ul>
<li>place benchmarks on desired processors;</li>
<li>place the benchmark memory on a desired memory unit;</li>
<li>do arithmetic (e.g. via shell commands) to derive a valid processor number from the SPEC copy number; </li>
<li>cause the tools to write each copy's benchmark invocation lines to a file, which is then sent to its processor; </li>
<li>reference a testbed description provided by the tester (such as a topology file).</li>
</ul>

<p>The <tt>submit</tt> command must not be used to change the run time environment (see section <a href="#rule_3.4">3.4</a>).
In addition, if a testbed description is referenced by a <tt>submit</tt> option, the same description must be used by all
benchmarks.</p>

<p>In base, the <tt>submit</tt> command must be the same for all benchmarks in a suite (integer or fp).  In peak, different
benchmarks may use different submit commands.</p>


<h3 id="rule_3.3">3.3 Continuous Run Requirement  </h3>

<p>All benchmark executions, including the validation steps, contributing to a particular result page must occur continuously,
that is, in one execution of <tt>runspec</tt>.  </p>

<p>For a reportable run, the <tt>runspec</tt> tool will run all three workloads (test, train, and ref), and will ensure that
the correct answer is obtained for all three.  (Note: the execution and validation of test and train is not part of the
timing of the benchmark - it is only an additional test for correct operation of the binary.)</p>

<h3 id="rule_3.4">3.4 Run-time environment</h3>

<p>SPEC does not attempt to regulate the run-time environment for the benchmarks, other than to require that the environment
be:</p>
<ul>
   <li>(a) set prior to <tt>runspec</tt> and consistent throughout the run,</li>
   <li>(b) fully described, and</li>
   <li>(c) in compliance with <a href="#rule_1">section&nbsp;1</a>, Philosophy.  </li>
</ul>
<p>For example, if each of the following:</p>

<p class="codeexample">run level:   single-user 
<br />OS tuning:   bigpages=yes, cpu_affinity=hard
<br />file system: in memory</p>

<p>were set prior to the start of <tt>runspec</tt>, unchanged during the run, described in the notes section of the result page, and documented and
supported by a vendor for general use, then these options could be used in a published CPU2006 result.</p>

<p>Note 1: Item (a) is intended to forbid all means by which a tester might change the environment.  In particular, it is
forbidden to change the environment during the run using config file hooks such as <tt>submit</tt> or
<tt>monitor_pre_bench</tt>.</p>

<p class="example">For example, it would not be acceptable to use <tt>submit</tt> to cause different benchmarks to pick
differing page sizes, differing number of threads, or differing choices for local vs. shared memory.</p>

<p>Note 2: Although the tester is not allowed to change the run-time environment, it <span class="u">is</span> acceptable to
select choices at compile time that cause benchmark binaries to carry information about their run time requirements.  </p>

<p class="example">For example, a compiler choice could be made that causes binaries to request running with bigpages, and, for
peak only, that choice could differ from benchmark to benchmark.</p>


<h3 id="rule_3.5">3.5 Base, peak, and basepeak</h3>

<p>If a result page will contain both base and peak results, a single <tt>runspec</tt> invocation must be used for the runs.
When both base and peak are run, the tools run the base executables first, followed by the peak executables.</p>

<p>It is permitted to publish base results as peak.  This can be accomplished in various ways, all of which are allowed:</p>
<ul>

<li><p>Set <tt>basepeak=yes</tt> in the config file for individual benchmarks.</p>  
<p>In this case, the tools will run the same binary for both base and peak; however, the base times will be reported for both
base and peak.  (The reason for running the binary during both base and peak is to remove the possibility that skipping a
benchmark altogether might somehow change the performance of some other benchmark.)</p></li>

<li><p>Set <tt>basepeak=yes</tt> in the config file for an entire suite.</p>   
<p>In this case, the peak runs will be skipped and base results will be reported as both base and peak for the
suite.</p></li>

<li><p>Select the <tt style="white-space:nowrap;">--basepeak</tt> option when using <tt>rawformat</tt>.</p>  
<p>Doing so will cause a new rawfile to be written, with base results copied to peak.  It is permitted to use this feature to
copy all of the base results to peak, or just the results for selected benchmarks.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>Notes: </p>

<p>1. It is permitted but not required to compile in the same <tt>runspec</tt> invocation as the execution.  See rule <a
href="#rule_2.0.6">2.0.6</a> regarding cross compilation.</p>

<p>2. It is permitted but not required to run both the integer suite and the floating point suite in a single invocation of
<tt>runspec</tt>.  </p>

<h3 id="rule_3.6">3.6 Run-Time Dynamic Optimization</h3>

<h4 id="rule_3.6.1">3.6.1 Definitions and Background</h4>

<p>As used in these run rules, the term "run-time dynamic optimization" (RDO) refers broadly to any method by which a system
adapts to improve performance of an executing program based upon observation of its behavior as it runs.  This is an
intentionally broad definition, intended to include techniques such as:</p>

<ul>
   <li class="tightli"> rearrangement of code to improve instruction cache performance</li>
   <li class="tightli"> replacement of emulated instructions by native code</li>
   <li class="tightli"> value prediction</li>
   <li class="tightli"> branch predictor training</li>
   <li class="tightli"> reallocation of on-chip functional units among hardware threads</li>
   <li class="tightli"> TLB training</li>
   <li class="tightli"> adjustment of the supply of big pages</li>
</ul>

<p>RDO may be under control of hardware, software, or both.</p>

<p>Understood this broadly, RDO is already commonly in use, and usage can be expected to increase.  SPEC believes that RDO is
useful, and does not wish to prevent its development.  Furthermore, SPEC views at least some RDO techniques as appropriate
for base, on the grounds that some techniques may require no special settings or user intervention; the system simply learns
about the workload and adapts.</p>

<p>However, benchmarking a system that includes RDO presents a challenge.  A central idea of SPEC benchmarking is to create
tests that are repeatable: if you run a benchmark suite multiple times, it is expected that results will be similar, although
there will be a small degree of run-to-run variation.  But an adaptive system may recognize the program that it is asked to
run, and "carry over" lessons learned in the previous execution; therefore, it might complete a benchmark more quickly each
time it is run.  Furthermore, unlike in real life, the programs in the benchmark suites are presented with the same inputs
each time they are run: value prediction is too easy if the inputs never change.  In the extreme case, an adaptive system
could be imagined that notices which program is about to run, notices what the inputs are, and which reduces the entire
execution to a print statement.   In the interest of benchmarking that is both repeatable and representative of real-life
usage, it is therefore necessary to place limits on RDO carry-over.</p>

<h4 id="rule_3.6.2">3.6.2 RDO Is Allowed, Subject to Certain Conditions</h4>

<p>Run time dynamic optimization is allowed, subject to the usual provisions that the techniques must be generally available,
documented, and supported.  It is also subject to the conditions listed in the rules immediately following.</p>

<h4 id="rule_3.6.3">3.6.3 RDO Disclosure and Resources</h4>

<p><a href="#rule_4.2">Rule 4.2</a> applies to run-time dynamic optimization: any settings which the tester has set to
non-default values must be disclosed.  If RDO requires any hardware resources, these must be included in the description of
the hardware configuration.</p>

<p class="example">For example, suppose that a system can be described as a 64-core system.  After experimenting for a while,
the tester decides that optimum SPECrate throughput is achieved by dedicating 4 cores to the run-time dynamic optimizer, and
running only 60 copies of the benchmarks.   The system under test is still correctly described as a 64-core system, even
though only 60 cores ran SPEC code.</p>

<h4 id="rule_3.6.4">3.6.4 RDO Settings Cannot Be Changed At Run-time</h4>

<p>Run time dynamic optimization is subject to <a href="#rule_3.4">rule 3.4</a>: settings cannot be changed at run-time.  But
Note 2 of rule 3.4 also applies to RDO: for example, in peak it would be acceptable to compile a subset of the benchmarks
with a flag that suggests to the run-time dynamic optimizer that code rearrangement should be attempted.  Of course, 
<a href="#rule_2.1.1">rule 2.1.1</a> also would apply: such a flag could not tell RDO which routines to rearrange.</p>

<h4 id="rule_3.6.5">3.6.5 RDO and safety in base</h4>

<p>If run-time dynamic optimization is effectively enabled for base (after taking into account the system state at run-time
and any compilation flags that interact with the run-time state), then RDO must comply with 2.2.1, the <a
href="#rule_2.2.1">safety rule</a>.  It is understood that the safety rule has sometimes required judgment, including
deliberation by SPEC in order to determine its applicability.  The following is intended as guidance for the tester and for
SPEC:</p>

<ul>
   <li><p>If an RDO system optimizes a SPEC benchmark in a way which allows it to successfully process the SPEC-supplied
   inputs, that is not enough to demonstrate safety.  If it can be shown that a different, but valid, input causes the
   program running under RDO to fail (either by giving a wrong answer or by exiting), where such failure does not occur
   without RDO; and if it is not a fault of the original source code; then this is taken as evidence that the RDO method is
   not safe.</p></li>

   <li><p>If an RDO system requires that programs use a subset of the relevant ANSI/ISO language standard, or requires that
   they use non-standard features, then this is taken as evidence that it is not safe.</p></li>

   <li><p>But an RDO system <b><i>is</i></b> allowed to assume that the programs adhere to the relevant ANSI/ISO language
   standard.</p></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="rule_3.6.6">3.6.6 RDO carry-over by program is not allowed</h4>

<p>As described in section 3.6.1, SPEC has an interest in preventing carry-over of information from run to run.  Specifically, 
no information may be carried over which identifies the specific program or executable image.  Here are some examples of 
behavior that is, and is not, allowed.</p>

<p>It doesn't matter whether the information is intentionally stored, or just "left over"; if it's about a specific 
program, it's not allowed:</p>

<ul>
   <li>Allowed: when a program is run, its use of emulated instructions is noticed by the run-time dynamic optimizer, and
   these are replaced as it runs, during this run only, by native code. </li>
   <li>Not allowed: when the program is re-run, a disk cache is consulted to find out what instructions were replaced last
   time, and the replacement code is used instead of the original program.</li>
   <li>Not allowed: when the program is re-run, the replacement native instructions are still sitting in memory, and the
   replacement instructions are used instead of the original program.</li>
</ul>

<p>If information is left over from a previous run that is <b><i>not</i></b> associated with a specific program, that
<b><i>is</i></b> allowed:</p>

<ul>
   <li> Allowed: a virtually-indexed branch predictor is trained during the reference run of 400.perlbench.
     When the second run of 400.perlbench is begun, a portion of the branch predictor tables happen to still
     be in the state that they were in at the end of the previous run (i.e. some entries have not been
     re-used during runs of intervening programs).</li>
   <li> Not allowed: a branch predictor specifically identifies certain virtual addresses belong to the executable for
     400.perlbench, and on the second run of that executable it uses that knowledge.</li>
</ul>

<p>Any form of RDO that uses memory about a specific program is forbidden:</p>
<ul>
   <li> Allowed: while 400.perlbench is running, the run-time dynamic optimizer notices that it seems to be doing a poor job
   of rearranging instructions for instruction cache packing today, and gives up for the duration of this run.</li>
   <li> Not allowed: the next time 400.perlbench runs, the run-time dynamic optimizer remembers that it had difficulty last
   time and decides not to even try this time.</li>
   <li> Not allowed: the run-time dynamic optimizer recognizes that this new program is 400.perlbench by the fact that it has
   the same filename, or has the same size, or has the same checksum, or contains the same symbols.</li>
</ul>

<p>The system is allowed to respond to the currently running program, and to the overall workload:</p>
<ul>
   <li> Allowed: the operating system notices that demand for big pages is intense for the currently running program, and 
     takes measures to increase their supply.</li>
   <li> Not allowed: the operating system notices that the demand for big pages is intense for certain programs, and takes
     measures to supply big pages to those specific programs.</li>
   <li> Allowed: the operating system notices that the demand for big pages is intense today, and takes measures to increase
   the supply of them.  This causes all but the first few SPECfp2006 benchmarks to run more quickly, as the bigpage
   supply is improved.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="rule_4">4. Results Disclosure</h2>

<p>SPEC requires a full disclosure of results and configuration details sufficient to reproduce the results.  For results
published on its web site, SPEC also requires
that base results be published whenever peak results are published.  If peak results are published outside of the SPEC web
site (<a href="http://www.spec.org/cpu2006/">http://www.spec.org/cpu2006/</a>) in a publicly available medium, the tester
must supply base results on request.  Publication of results under non-disclosure or company internal use or company
confidential are not "publicly" available. </p>

<p>A full disclosure of results must include:</p>
<ul>
   <li>The components of the disclosure page, as generated by the SPEC tools.  </li>

   <li>The tester's configuration file and any supplemental files needed to build the executables used to generate the
   results.</li>

   <li>A flags definition disclosure.</li>
</ul>

<p>A full disclosure of results must include sufficient information to allow a result to be independently reproduced.  If a
tester is aware that a configuration choice affects performance, then s/he must document it in the full disclosure.</p>

<p>Note: this rule is not meant to imply that the tester must describe irrelevant details or provide massively redundant
information.  </p>

<p class="example">For example, if the SuperHero Model 1 comes with a write-through cache, and the SuperHero Model 2 comes with
a write-back cache, then specifying the model number is sufficient, and no additional steps need to be taken to document the
cache protocol.  But if the Model 3 is available with both write-through and write-back caches, then a full disclosure must
specify which cache is used.</p>

<p>For information on how to publish a result on SPEC's web site, contact the SPEC office.  Contact information is maintained at the SPEC
web site, <a href="http://www.spec.org/">http://www.spec.org/</a>.</p>


<h3 id="rule_4.1">4.1 Rules regarding availability date and systems not yet shipped</h3>

<p>If a tester publishes results for a hardware or software configuration that has not yet shipped, </p>
<ul>
   <li><p>The component suppliers must have firm plans to make production versions of all components generally available,
   within 3 months of the first public release of the result (whether first published by the tester or by SPEC); and</p></li>

   <li><p>The tester must specify the general availability dates that are planned.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Note 1: "Generally available" is defined in the SPEC Open Systems Group Policy document, which can be found at <a
href="http://www.spec.org/osg/policy.html">http://www.spec.org/osg/policy.html</a>.</p>

<p>Note 2: It is acceptable to test larger configurations than customers are currently ordering, provided that the larger
configurations can be ordered and the company is prepared to ship them.</p>

<p class="example">For example, if the SuperHero is available in configurations of 1 to 1000 CPUs, but the largest order
received to date is for 128 CPUs, the tester would still be at liberty to test a 1000 CPU configuration and publish the
result.</p>

<h4 id="rule_4.1.1">4.1.1 Pre-production software can be used</h4>

<p>A "pre-production", "alpha", "beta", or other pre-release version of a compiler (or other software) can be used in a test,
provided that the performance-related features of the software are committed for inclusion in the final product.  </p>

<p>The tester must practice due diligence to ensure that the tests do not use an uncommitted prototype with no particular
shipment plans.  An example of due diligence would be a memo from the compiler Project Leader which asserts that the tester's
version accurately represents the planned product, and that the product will ship on date X. </p>

<p>The final, production version of all components must be generally available within 3 months after first public release of
the result.</p>

<h4 id="rule_4.1.2">4.1.2 Software component names</h4>

<p>When specifying a software component name in the results disclosure, the component name that should be used is the name
that customers are expected to be able to use to order the component, as best as can be determined by the tester.  It is
understood that sometimes this may not be known with full accuracy; for example, the tester may believe that the component
will be called "TurboUnix V5.1.1" and later find out that it has been renamed "TurboUnix V5.2", or even "Nirvana 1.0".  In
such cases, an editorial request can be made to update the result after publication.</p>

<p>Some testers may wish to also specify the exact identifier of the version actually used in the test (for example, "build
20020604").  Such additional identifiers may aid in later result reproduction, but are not required; the key point is to
include the name that customers will be able to use to order the component.</p>

<h4 id="rule_4.1.3">4.1.3 Specifying dates</h4>

<p>The configuration disclosure includes fields for both "Hardware Availability" and "Software Availability".  In both cases,
the date which must be used is the date of the component which is the <b>last</b> of the respective type to become generally
available.</p> 

<h4 id="rule_4.1.4">4.1.4 If dates are not met</h4>

<p>If a software or hardware date changes, but still falls within 3 months of first publication, a result page may be updated
on request to SPEC.</p>

<p>If a software or hardware date changes to more than 3 months after first publication, the result is considered
Non-Compliant.  For procedures regarding Non-Compliant results, see the SPEC Open Systems Group (OSG) Policy Document, <a
href="http://www.spec.org/osg/policy.html">http://www.spec.org/osg/policy.html</a>.</p>

<h4 id="rule_4.1.5">4.1.5 Performance changes for pre-production systems</h4>

<p>SPEC is aware that performance results for pre-production systems may sometimes be subject to change, for example when a
last-minute bugfix reduces the final performance.  </p>

<p>For results measured on pre-production systems, if the tester becomes aware of something that will reduce production
system performance by more than 1.75% on an overall metric (for example, SPECfp_base2006 or SPECfp2006), the tester is
required to republish the result, and the original result shall be considered non-compliant.</p>



<h3 id="rule_4.2">4.2 Configuration Disclosure </h3>

<p>The following sections describe the various elements that make up the disclosure for the system and test configuration used
to produce a given test result.  The SPEC tools used for the benchmark allow setting this information in the configuration
file: </p>


<h4 id="rule_4.2.1">4.2.1 System Identification</h4>

<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
   <li> <b>Model Name</b></li>
   <li> <b>Test Date</b>: Month, Year</li>
   <li> <b>Hardware Availability Date</b>: Month, Year.  If more than one date applies, use the latest one.</li>
   <li> <b>Software Availability Date</b>: Month, Year.  If more than one date applies, use the latest one.</li>
   <li> <b>Hardware Vendor</b> </li>
   <li> <b>Test sponsor</b>: the entity sponsoring the testing (defaults to hardware vendor). </li>
   <li> <b>Tester</b>: the entity actually carrying out the tests (defaults to test sponsor). </li>
   <li> <b>CPU2006 license number</b> of the test sponsor or the tester </li>
</ol>


<h4 id="rule_4.2.2">4.2.2 Hardware Configuration</h4>

<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
   <li><p><b>CPU Name:</b> A manufacturer-determined processor formal name.</p></li>
   <li><p><b>CPU Characteristics:</b> Technical characteristics to help identify the processor.</p> 
      <ol>
         <li><p>This field must be used to disambiguate which processor is used, unless the CPU is already unambiguously designated
             by the combination of the fields "CPU Name", "CPU MHz", "FPU", and "Level (n) Cache".</p></li>
         <li><p>In addition, SPEC encourages use of this field to make it easier for the reader to identify a processor, even if
             the processor choice is not, technically, ambiguous. </p></li>
         <li><p>SPEC does not require that CPU2006 results be published on the SPEC web site, although such publication is encouraged.  For 
             results that are published on its web site, SPEC is likely to use this field to note CPU technical characteristics that SPEC 
             may deem useful for queries, and may adjust its contents from time to time.</p></li>
         <li><p>Some processor differences may not be relevant to performance, such as differences in packaging, distribution 
             channels, or CPU revision levels that affect a SPEC CPU2006 overall performance metric by less than 1.75%.  In 
             those cases, SPEC does not require disambiguation as to which processor was tested.</p></li>
         </ol>

      An example may help to clarify these four points.

         <p class="example">For example, when first introduced, the TurboBlaster series is available with only one instruction set,
         and runs at speeds up to 2GHz.  Later, a second instruction set (known as "Arch2") is introduced and older processors are
         commonly, but informally, referred to as having employed "Arch1", even though they were not sold with that term at the
         time.   Chips with Arch2 are sold at speeds of 2GHz and higher.  The manufacturer has chosen to call both Arch1 and Arch2
         chips by the same formal chip name (TurboBlaster).</p>
         <p class="example">1. A 2.0GHz TurboBlaster result is published.  Since the formal chip name is the same, and since both 
         Arch1 and Arch2 are available at 2.0GHz, the CPU Characteristics field <b>must</b> be used to identify whether this is 
         an Arch1 or Arch2 chip.</p>
         <p class="example">2. A 2.2GHz TurboBlaster result is published.  In this case, there is technically no ambiguity, since 
         all 2.2GHz results use Arch2.  Nevertheless, the tester is encouraged to note that the chip uses Arch2, to help the 
         reader disambiguate the processors.</p>
         <p class="example">3. As an aid to technical readers doing queries, SPEC may decide to adjust all the TurboBlaster results 
         that have been posted on its website by adding either "Arch1" or "Arch2" to all posted results.</p>
         <p class="example">4. The 2.2GHz TurboBlaster is available in an OEM package and a Consumer package.  These are highly 
         similar, although the OEM version has additional testing features for use by OEMs.   But these are both 2.2GHz 
         TurboBlasters, with the same cache structure, same instruction set, and, within run-to-run variation, the same CPU2006 
         performance.  In this case, it is not necessary to specify whether the OEM or Consumer version was tested.</p>
         </li>

   <li><p><b>CPU MHz:</b> a numeric value expressed in megahertz.  That is, do not say "1.0 GHz", say "1000".  The value here is
       to be the speed at which the CPU is run, even if the chip itself is sold at a different clock rate.  That is, if you
       "over-clock" or "under-clock" the part, disclose here the actual speed used.</p></li>

   <li><p><b>FPU</b></p></li>

   <li><p id="cpucount"><b>Number of CPUs in System</b>. As of early 2006, it is assumed that processors can be described
   as containing one
   or more "chips", each of which contains some number of "cores", each of which can run some number of hardware "threads".
   Fields are provided in the results disclosure for each of these.  If industry practice evolves such that these terms are
   no longer sufficient to describe processors, SPEC may adjust the field set.</p>

   <p>The current fields are:</p>

     <ul>
     <li><tt>hw_ncores</tt>: number of processor cores enabled (total) during this test</li>
     <li><tt>hw_nchips</tt>: number of processor chips enabled during this test</li>
     <li><tt>hw_ncoresperchip</tt>: number of cores that are manufactured into a chip</li>
     <li><tt>hw_nthreadspercore</tt>: number of hardware threads enabled (per core) during this test</li>
     </ul>

    <p>Regarding the fields in the above list that mention the word "enabled": if a chip, core, or thread is available for
    use during the test, then it must be counted.  If one of these resources is disabled - for example by a firmware setting
    prior to boot - then it need not be counted, but the tester must exercise due diligence to ensure that disabled resources
    are truly disabled, and not silently giving help to the result.  </p>

    <p>Regarding the remaining field (<tt>hw_ncoresperchip</tt>), the tester must count the cores irrespective of whether
    they are enabled.</p>

      <p class="example">Example:  In the following tests, the SUT is a Turboblaster Model 32-64-256, which contains 32
      chips.  Each chip has 2 cores.  Each core can run 4 hardware threads.  </p>

      <ol>
      <li class="example"><p>A 256-copy SPECint_rate2006 test uses all the available resources.  It is reported as:</p>
<pre>
             hw_ncores:            64
             hw_nchips:            32
             hw_ncoresperchip:      2
             hw_nthreadspercore:    4
</pre></li>
      <li class="example"><p>The same system is tested with a 24-copy SPECint_rate2006 test, without changing the system
      configuration.  Even though they are now only lightly loaded, all the above resources are still configured into the
      SUT; therefore the SUT must still be described as:</p>
<pre>
             hw_ncores:            64
             hw_nchips:            32
             hw_ncoresperchip:      2
             hw_nthreadspercore:    4
</pre></li>
      <li class="example"><p>The system is halted, and firmware commands are entered to disable all but 3 of the chips.  All
      resources are available on the remaining 3 chips.  The system is rebooted and a 24-copy test is run once more.  This
      time, the resources are: </p>
<pre>
             hw_ncores:             6
             hw_nchips:             3
             hw_ncoresperchip:      2
             hw_nthreadspercore:    4
</pre></li>
      <li class="example"><p>The system is halted, and firmware commands are entered to enable 24 chips; but only 1 core is
      enabled per chip, and hardware threading is turned off.  The system is booted, and a 24-copy test is run.  The
      resources this time are:</p>
<pre>
             hw_ncores:            24
             hw_nchips:            24
             hw_ncoresperchip:      2
             hw_nthreadspercore:    1
</pre></li>
      </ol>

    <p>Note: if resources are disabled, the method(s) used for 
    such disabling must be documented and supported.</p></li>

   <li><p><b>Number of CPUs orderable</b>.  Specify the number of processors
   that can be ordered, using whatever units the customer would
   use when placing an order.  If necessary, provide a mapping
   from that unit to the chips/cores units just above.  For
   example: </p>
   
     <p class="example">1 to 8 TurboCabinets.  Each TurboCabinet contains 4 chips.</p></li>

   <li><p><b>Level 1 (primary) Cache</b>: Size, location, number of instances (e.g. "<tt>32 KB I + 64 KB D on chip per

   <li><p><b>Level 2 (secondary) Cache</b>: Size, location, number of instances </p></li>
   <li><p><b>Level 3 (tertiary) Cache</b>: Size, location, number of instances </p></li>
   <li><p><b>Other Cache</b>: Size, location, number of instances </p></li>
   <li><p><b>Memory</b>: Size in MB/GB.  <span id="memoryconfig">Performance relevant information as to the 
      memory configuration</span> must be included, either in the field or in the notes 
      section.  If there is one and only one way to configure memory of the stated 
      size, then no
      additional detail need be disclosed.   But if a buyer of the system has choices to make, then the result page must
      document the choices that were made by the tester. </p> 

      <p class="example">For example, the tester may need to document number of memory carriers, size of DIMMs, banks,
      interleaving, access time, or even arrangement of modules: which sockets were used, which were left empty, which
      sockets had the bigger DIMMs.</p>

      <p>Exception: if the tester has evidence that a memory configuration choice does not affect performance, then SPEC does
      not require disclosure of the choice made by the tester.  </p>

      <p class="example">For example, if a 1GB system is known to perform identically whether configured with 8 x 128MB DIMMs
      or 4 x 256MB DIMMs, then SPEC does not require disclosure of which choice was made.</p></li>

   <li><p><b>Disk Subsystem</b>: Size (MB/GB), Type (SCSI, Fast SCSI etc.), other performance-relevant characteristics.  The

   <p class="example">but the tester knows that the new code generator will be automatically applied in the final product, and
   that the spelling of the unroll switch will be simpler than the spelling used here.  The recommended spelling for customers
   who wish to achieve the effect of the above command will be:</p>
   <p class="codeexample">f90 -O4 -no-outer-unroll</p>
   <p class="example"> In this case, the flags report will include the actual spelling used by the tester, but a note should
   be added to document the spelling that will be recommended for customers.</p></li>

</ol>

<h4 id="rule_4.2.5">4.2.5 Description of Tuning Options ("Flags File") </h4>

<p>SPEC CPU2006 provides benchmarks in source code form, which are compiled under control of SPEC's toolset.  Compilation flags
are detected and reported by the tools with the help of "flag description files".  Such files provide information about the
syntax of flags and their meaning.  </p>

<p>A result will be marked "invalid" unless it has an associated flag description file.  A description of how to write one may
be found at <a href="http://www.spec.org/cpu2006/Docs">www.spec.org/cpu2006/Docs</a>.  </p>

<p>The level of detail in the description of a flag is expected to be sufficient so that an interested technical reader can form
a preliminary judgment of whether he or she would also want to apply the option.  </p>

<ul>
  <li><p> This requirement is phrased as a "preliminary judgment" because a complete judgment of a performance option often
  requires testing with the user's own application, to ensure that there are no unintended consequences.</p></li>

  <li><p> At minimum, if a flag has implications for safety, accuracy, or standards conformance, such implications must be
  disclosed.  </p></li>

  <li><p> For example, one might write:</p> 
  <p class="example">When --algebraII is used, the compiler is allowed to use the rules of elementary algebra to simplify
  expressions and perform calculations in an order that it deems efficient.  This flag allows the compiler to perform
  arithmetic in an order that may differ from the order indicated by programmer-supplied parentheses.</p>
  
  </li>

  <li><p> The final sentence of the preceding paragraph is an example of a deviation from a standard which must be
  disclosed.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>It is acceptable, and even common practice, for testers to build on each others' flags files, copying all or part of flags
files posted by others into their own flags files; but doing so does not relieve an individual tester of the responsibility to
ensure that the description is accurate.</p>

<p>Although these descriptions have historically been called "flags files", they must also include descriptions of other
performance-relevant options that have been selected, including but not limited to environment variables, kernel options,
file system tuning options, BIOS options, and options for any other performance-relevant software packages.  </p>

<p><b>Description of Feedback-directed optimization</b></p>

<p>If feedback directed optimization is used, the description must
indicate whether training runs:</p>

<ul>
<li> gather information regarding execution paths</li>
<li> gather information regarding data values</li>
<li> use hardware performance counters</li>
<li> gather data for optimizations unique to FDO</li>
</ul>

<p>Hardware performance counters are often available to provide information such as branch mispredict frequencies, cache
misses, or instruction frequencies.  If they are used during the training run, the description needs to note this; but SPEC
does not require a description of exactly which performance counters are used.</p>
                                                                                                           
<p>As with any other optimization, if the optimizations performed have effects regarding safety, accuracy, or standards
conformance, these effects must be described.</p>

<h3 id="rule_4.3">4.3 Test Results Disclosure</h3>

<p>The actual test results consist of the elapsed times and ratios for the individual benchmarks and the overall SPEC metric
produced by running the benchmarks via the SPEC tools.  The required use of the SPEC tools ensures that the results generated
are based on benchmarks built, run, and validated according to the SPEC run rules.  Below is a list of the measurement
components for each SPEC CPU2006 suite and metric: </p>

<h4 id="rule_4.3.1">4.3.1   Speed Metrics</h4>

<pre>
o CINT2006 Speed Metrics: 
     <b>SPECint_base2006</b>  (Required Base result)
     <b>SPECint2006</b>       (Optional Peak result)

o CFP2006 Speed Metrics:  
     <b>SPECfp_base2006</b>   (Required Base result)
     <b>SPECfp2006</b>        (Optional Peak result)
</pre>

<p>The elapsed time in seconds for each of the benchmarks in the CINT2006 or CFP2006 suite is given and the ratio to the
reference machine (a Sun UltraSparc II system at 296MHz), is calculated.  The SPECint_base2006 and SPECfp_base2006 metrics
are calculated as a Geometric Mean of the individual ratios, where each ratio is based on the median execution time from
three runs.  All runs of a specific benchmark when using the SPEC tools are required to have validated correctly.</p>

<p>The benchmark executables must have been built according to the rules described in <a href="#rule_2.0">section&nbsp;2</a>
above.  </p>

<h4 id="rule_4.3.2">4.3.2   Throughput Metrics</h4>

<pre>
o CINT2006 Throughput Metrics:    
        <b>SPECint_rate_base2006</b> (Required Base result)
        <b>SPECint_rate2006</b>      (Optional Peak result)

o CFP2006 Throughput Metrics:     
        <b>SPECfp_rate_base2006</b>  (Required Base result)
        <b>SPECfp_rate2006</b>       (Optional Peak result)
</pre>

<p>The throughput metrics are calculated based on the execution of benchmark binaries that are built using the same rules as
binaries built for speed metrics.  However, the tester may select the number of concurrent copies of each benchmark to be
run.  The same number of copies must be used for all benchmarks in a base test.  This is not true for the peak results where
the tester is free to select any combination of copies.  The number of copies selected is usually a function of the number of
CPUs in the system. </p>

<p>The "rate" calculated for each benchmark is a function of: <tt>
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the number of copies run * 
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reference factor for the benchmark / 
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;elapsed time in seconds</tt> 
<br />which yields a rate in jobs/time.  The rate metrics are calculated as a geometric mean from the individual SPECrates
using the median result from three runs.  As with the speed metric, all copies of the benchmark during each run are required
to have validated correctly.</p>

<p>It is permitted to use the SPEC tools to generate a 1-cpu rate disclosure from a 1-cpu speed run.  The reverse is not
permitted.</p>

<h4 id="rule_4.3.3">4.3.3 Performance changes for production systems</h4>

<p>As mentioned <a href="#rule_4.1.5">above</a>, performance may sometimes change for pre-production systems; but this is
also true of production systems (that is, systems that have already begun shipping).  For example, a later revision to the
firmware, or a mandatory OS bugfix, might reduce performance.</p> 

<p>For production systems, if the tester becomes aware of something that reduces performance by more than 1.75% on an overall
metric (for example, SPECfp_base2006 or SPECfp2006), the tester is encouraged but not required to republish the result.  In
such cases, the original result is not considered non-compliant.  The tester is also encouraged, but not required, to include
a reference to the change that makes the results different (e.g. "with OS patch 20020604-02").</p>

<h3 id="rule_4.4">4.4  Metric Selection</h3>

<p>Publication of peak results are considered optional by SPEC, so the tester may choose to publish only base results.  Since
by definition base results adhere to all the rules that apply to peak results, the tester may choose to refer to these
results by either the base or peak metric names (e.g. SPECint_base2006 or SPECint2006).</p>

<p>It is permitted to publish base-only results.  Alternatively, the use of the flag <tt>basepeak</tt> is permitted, as
described in <a href="#rule_3.5">section&nbsp;3.5</a>.</p>

<h3 id="rule_4.5">4.5 Research and Academic usage of CPU2006</h3>

<p>SPEC encourages use of the CPU2006 suites in academic and research environments.  It is understood that experiments in
such environments may be conducted in a less formal fashion than that demanded of testers who publish on the SPEC web
site.  For example, a research environment may use early prototype hardware that simply cannot be expected to stay up for the
length of time required to meet the Continuous Run requirement (see <a href="#rule_3.3">section&nbsp;3.3</a>), or may use
research compilers that are unsupported and are not generally available (see <a href="#rule_1">section&nbsp;1</a>).</p>

<p>Nevertheless, SPEC would like to encourage researchers to obey as many of the run rules as practical, even for informal
research.  SPEC respectfully suggests that following the rules will improve the clarity, reproducibility, and comparability
of research results.</p>

<p>Where the rules cannot be followed, SPEC requires that the deviations from the rules be clearly disclosed, and that any
SPEC metrics (such as SPECint2006) be clearly marked as estimated. </p>

<p>It is especially important to clearly distinguish results that do not comply with the run rules when the areas of
non-compliance are major, such as not using the reference workload, or only being able to correctly validate a subset of the
benchmarks.</p>

<h3 id="rule_4.6">4.6 Required Disclosures  </h3>

<p>If a SPEC CPU2006 licensee publicly discloses a CPU2006 result (for example in a press release, academic paper, magazine
article, or public web site), and does not clearly mark the result as an estimate, any SPEC member may request that the
rawfile(s) from the run(s) be sent to SPEC.  Such results must be made available to all interested members no later than 10
working days after the request.</p>

<p>Any SPEC member may request that the result and its rawfile be reviewed by the appropriate SPEC subcommittee.  If the
tester does not wish to have the result posted on the SPEC web pages, the result will not be posted. </p>

<p>But when public claims are made about CPU2006 results, whether by vendors or by academic researchers, SPEC reserves the
right to take actions, for example if it should occur that the rawfile is not made available, or shows substantially
different performance from the tester's claim, or shows obvious violations of the run rules.</p>

<h3 id="rule_4.7">4.7 Fair Use  </h3>

<p>Any public use of SPEC CPU2006 results must, at the time of publication, adhere to the then-currently-posted version of
SPEC's Fair Use Rules, <a href="http://www.spec.org/fairuse.html">http://www.spec.org/fairuse.html</a>.</p>

<p>If a competitive comparison uses SPEC CPU2006, it must use one or more of the following metrics:</p>

<ul>
<li> <p>The overall results: SPECint_base2006, SPECint2006, SPECfp_base2006, SPECfp2006, SPECint_base_rate2006,
SPECint_rate2006, SPECfp_base_rate2006, SPECfp_rate2006;</p></li>

<li> <p>Median run times of the individual benchmarks [see <a href="#s4.7note1">Note 1</a>];</p></li>

<li> <p>Median individual benchmark SPECratios [see <a href="#s4.7note1">Note 1</a>];</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The basis for comparison must be stated.  Information from result pages may be used to define a basis for comparing a
subset of systems, including but not limited to operating system version, cache size, memory size, compiler version, or
compiler optimizations used.</p>

<p>All public statements regarding SPEC, its benchmarks, and especially results posted at www.spec.org, are required to be
scrupulously correct as of the date listed in the public statement.  However, there is no requirement to update public
statements as new results are published.  For example, if a web page says that the Turboblaster 1000 has "the best
SPECint2006 result when compared versus all results published at www.spec.org through July 1, 2006", there is no requirement
to change that web page if a better result is published on July 2.</p>

<p id="s4.7note1"><i><b>Note 1</b>:  Regarding the use of non-median individual benchmark results: As described in <a
href="#rule_4.3">section 4.3</a>, each benchmark is run multiple times and the median is picked from the set of runs.  Any
result from such a set may be mentioned in a competitive comparison, provided that the median from the same set is also
mentioned</i></p>

<h3 id="rule_4.8">4.8 Estimates are allowed</h3>

<p>SPEC CPU2006 metrics may be estimated.  All estimates must be clearly identified as such.  </p>

<p>SPEC requires that every use of an estimated number be clearly marked with "est." or "estimated" next to each estimated
number, rather than burying a footnote at the bottom of a page.
</p>

<p class="example">For example, say that the JumboFast will achieve estimated performance of:</p> 
<pre>          Model 1   SPECint_base2006  50 est.
                    SPECint2006       60 est.
          Model 2   SPECint_rate2006  70 est.
                    SPECfp_rate2006   80 est.
</pre>

<p>For graphs, the word "estimated" must be plainly visible next to the scale or the title.</p>

<p>Licensees are encouraged to give a rationale or methodology for any estimates, together with other information that may
help the reader assess the accuracy of the estimate.  For example:</p>
<ol>
<li>"This is a measured estimate: SPEC CPU2006 was run on pre-production hardware.  Customer systems, planned for Q4, are
expected to be similar."</li>
<li>"Performance estimates are modeled using the cycle simulator GrokSim Mark IV.  It is likely that actual hardware, if
built, would include significant differences."</li>
</ol>

<p>Those who publish estimates are encouraged to publish actual SPEC CPU2006 metrics as soon as possible. </p>

<h2 id="rule_5">5.  Run Rule Exceptions</h2>

<p>If for some reason, the tester cannot run the benchmarks as specified in these rules, the tester can seek SPEC
approval for performance-neutral alternatives.  No publication may be done without such approval.  The SPEC Open Systems
Group (OSG) maintains a
Policies and Procedures document that defines the procedures for such exceptions.
