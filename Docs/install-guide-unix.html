<h2 id="steps">Installation Steps</h2>

<p>The SPEC CPU2006 suite has been tested under Unix, Linux, Mac OS X and Windows XP systems.  Your DVD can be installed
under many operating systems.  </p>

   <p class="l1"><span class="alarm">Reminder: the SPEC license allows you to install on multiple systems as you may wish
   within your institution; but you may not share the software with the public.</span></p>

<p>The installation procedure for Unix, Linux, and Mac OS X is as follows:</p>

<ol>


<li><p> Review the hardware and software requirements, in
     <a href="system-requirements.html">system-requirements.html</a></p>

      <p class="commentarystart" style="margin-top:.5em"> <i>Note:</i> links to SPEC CPU2006 documents on this web page
      assume that you are reading the page from a directory that also contains the other SPEC CPU2006 documents.  If by
      some chance you are reading this web page from a location where the links do not work, try accessing the referenced
      documents at one of the following locations:</p>
      <ul class="commentaryul">
      <li class="commentaryli"><a href="http://www.spec.org/cpu2006/Docs/">www.spec.org/cpu2006/Docs/</a></li>
      <li class="commentaryli">The <span class="ttnobr">$SPEC/Docs/</span> (Unix) or <span class="ttnobr">%SPEC%\Docs\</span>
      (Windows) directory on a system where SPEC CPU2006 has been installed.</li>
      <li class="commentaryli">The <span class="tt">Docs/</span> directory on your SPEC CPU2006 distribution DVD.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="commentaryend"></p>

</li>


<li><p> Create a directory on the destination disk.  You should make sure that you have a disk that has at least 8GB free.
(For more information on disk usage, see <a href="system-requirements.html">system-requirements.html</a>.)</p></li>

<li id="mount"><p> Mount the DVD.  For Mac OS X and some versions of Unix and Linux such as SUSE the DVD will be
automatically mounted.  For some systems, you may have to enter an explicit mount command.  If your operating system supports
the Rock Ridge Interchange Protocol extensions to ISO 9660, be sure to select them, unless they are the default.  The
following examples are not intended to be comprehensive, but may get you started or at least give you clues which manpages to
read:</p>

<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="border-color:#d0d0d0; margin:.5em 3em;"> 
<tr>
    <td valign="top"><b>AIX:</b></td>
     <td><kbd>        <b>mount -v cdrfs -r /dev/cd0 /cdrom</b>
     </kbd></td>

     <td><kbd>         <b>pfs_mountd &amp;

                     <br />(Obtain the device name via <kbd>ioscan -funCdisk</kbd>.  See the manpages for pfs, pfsd,
                     pfs_mount, pfs_mountd, and pfs_umount.  You will need the latter in order to eject the DVD.)
     </td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td valign="top"><b>Linux:</b></td>
     <td><kbd>        <b>mount -t iso9660 -o ro,exec /dev/cdrom /mnt</b>
     </kbd></td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td valign="top"><b>Solaris:</b></td>

     <td>             If Volume Management is running, you should find that the DVD is automatically mounted, as
                     <tt>/cdrom/label_of_volume/  </tt> If not, you should be able to mount it with commands similar to this:
             <br /><kbd> <b>mkdir /mnt1
             <br />mount -F hsfs -o ro /dev/dsk/c0t6d0s0 /mnt1</b>
     </kbd></td>
</tr>
</table>

   <p>Note that you may need root privileges to mount the DVD.</p>

<p><b>The following paragraphs assume that your DVD drive is on the same system as where you
wish to install.  If it is on a different system, please see the <a href="#appendix">appendix</a>.</b></p></li>

<li><p> Set your current working directory to the directory where the DVD is mounted.</p></li>

<li id="doinstall"><p> Type 
    <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<kbd><b>./install.sh</b></kbd>

   <br />When prompted, enter the destination directory.  Note that for a destination directory, you will have to use syntax
   acceptable to sh (so you might need to say <kbd>$HOME</kbd> instead of <kbd>~</kbd>).</p>

   <p>The installation procedure will attempt to determine your current architecture.  If a possible match is found, you will
   see a message such as this one:</p>
   <pre>
      These appear to be valid toolsets: </pre>

   <p>Note that you MUST type in the architecture that you wish to use:  type the name exactly as it appears (or use cut and
   paste).  If there is only one choice you can type "y" or "n" to accept or decline that architecture</p>

   <p>If the installation procedure is unable to determine your system architecture, you will see a message such as this
   one:</p>
   <pre>
       We do not appear to have vendor supplied binaries for your architecture.  </pre>

   <p>If you see that message, please stop here, and examine the file <a href="tools-build.html">tools-build.html</a></p>

<p> Thousands of files will be installed on your destination disk.  (If you would prefer to see them all named you
can set <kbd>VERBOSE=1</kbd> in your environment before installing the kit.)  You should see summary messages such as
these:</p>

	Checking the integrity of your binary tools...

	Checksums are all okay.
	Top of SPEC benchmark tree is <b>'/Users/peg/CPU2006'</b>  <b>&lt;&lt;-- your directory</b>
	Everything looks okay.  cd to <b>/Users/peg/CPU2006/</b>,  <b>&lt;&lt;-- your directory</b>
	source the shrc file and have at it!

</pre>

   <p>At this point, you will have consumed about 1.5GB of disk space on the destination drive.  </p></li>

<li><p>Change your current directory to the top-level SPEC directory and source 
   either <span class="tt">shrc</span> or <span class="tt">cshrc</span>:</p>

      <ul>

      <li class="l1"><p>For example, if you are using a Bourne-compatible shell (such as ash, bash, ksh, zsh), you could
      type:</p>
      <div class="l1ex">Users$ <b>cd /Users/peg/cpu2006/</b><br />
      cpu2006$ <b>. ./shrc</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;-- <i>that's dot-space-dot-slash-shrc</i></div></li>

      <li class="l1"><p>If you are using a csh-compatible shell, you could type: </p>
      <div class="l1ex"><span class="ttnobr">Users%
      <b>cd /bigdisk/bob/cpu2006</b><br />
      cpu2006% <b>source cshrc</b></span></div>
      <p class="l1"><span class="new">(The cshrc script is new with CPU2006)</span></p></li>
      </ul>

   <p>The effect of the above commands is to set up environment variables and paths for SPEC. </p></li> 

<li><p> Test that you can build a benchmark using the config file supplied for your system.  For example:</p>
   <pre>
       % <b>runspec --config=macosx-ia32-iccifortv91.cfg --action=build --tune=base bzip2</b> </pre>

   <p>The above command assumes that you can identify a config file (in the directory <tt>$SPEC/config</tt>) that is
   appropriate for you.   For a quick introduction to config files, see <a href="runspec.html#about_config">"About Config
   Files" in runspec.html</a></p>

   <p>The "<kbd>--tune=base</kbd>" above indicates that we want to use only the simple tuning, if more than one kind of
   tuning is supplied in the config file.</p></li>

<li><p> Test that you can run a benchmark, using the minimal input set - the "test" workload.  For example:</p>
   <pre>
       % <b>runspec --config=macosx-ia32-iccifortv91.cfg --size=test --tune=base \
                    --noreportable --iterations=1 bzip2</b></pre>
   
   <p>The "\" above indicates that the command is continued on the next line.  The "<kbd>--noreportable</kbd>" ensures that
   the tools will allow us to run just a single benchmark instead of the whole suite, and "<kbd>--iterations=1</kbd>" says
   just run the benchmark once.</p></li>

<li><p> Test that you can run a benchmark using the real input set - the "reference" workload.  For example:</p>
    <pre>
       % <b>runspec --config=macosx-ia32-iccifortv91.cfg --size=ref \
                    --noreportable --iterations=1 bzip2</b></pre>

    <p>Check the results in <tt>$SPEC/result</tt>.</p></li>

<li><p> Have a look at <a href="runspec.html">runspec.html</a> to learn how to do a full run of the suite. Also the command
<span class="ttnobr"><b>runspec -h</b></span> will list the various options for <tt>runspec</tt></p></li>

  http://www.spec.org/cpu2006/Docs/techsupport

A more recent config file for your platform may be among result submissions at

  http://www.spec.org/cpu2006/ 

Generally, issues with compilation should be directed to the compiler vendor.
You can find hints about how to debug problems by looking at the section on
"Troubleshooting" in
  http://www.spec.org/cpu2006/Docs/config.html

This warning will go away if you rename your config file to something other
than one of the names of the presupplied config files.

<p class="commentarystart">Notice the three separate sets of files:  .002, .003, and .004</p>

<p class="commentarycont"><tt>CPU2006.002.log</tt> has the log from the compile.</p>

<p class="commentarycont"><tt>CPU2006.003.log</tt> has the log from running <tt>401.bzip2</tt> with the "test" input.  The
various outputs (<tt>.csv, .pdf, .ps, .txt</tt>), a compiler flags report (<tt>.flags.html</tt>), and the configuration file
(<tt>.cfg</tt>) are all preceded by "<tt>CINT2006</tt>", because <tt>401.bzip2</tt> is one of the integer benchmarks.  The
tools also distinguish the fact that the input was a "test" input by putting that in the file name as well.</p>

<p class="commentarycont"><tt>CPU2006.004.log</tt> has the log from running <tt>401.bzip2</tt> with the "ref" input.  Once
again, the various outputs and the configuration file (<tt>.cfg</tt>) all start with CINT2006. </p>

<p class="commentarycont">The careful reader may wonder: "What happened to <tt>*001*</tt> files?"  The answer is that the
author of this example had a fat-finger experience when trying to enter the correct <tt>runspec</tt> command and did not like
the results, and so deleted them.  Doing so is harmless to the other logs, and can help organize a result directory by
getting the clutter out of the way.  To remove everything associated with run #1, simply type "<tt>rm *001*</tt>"; or if you
feel nervous about that, try something like "<span class="ttnobr">mkdir hideme; mv *001* hideme</span>". Doing either of
these will not cause the <tt>runspec</tt> tools to complain.</p>

<p class="commentaryend">So let's look at our reference input results, in the <tt>.txt</tt> file:</p>

<p class="commentary">Done.  The suite is installed, and we can run at least one benchmark for real (see the report of the
time spent in 401.bzip2 above). </p> 

<hr />

<h2 id="appendix">Appendix: the DVD drive is on system A, but I want to install on system B.  What do I do?</h2>

<p>If the title of this section describes your situation, you basically have two choices.</p>
<ol>
   <li><a href="#network">Network mount</a>: You can mount the device over the network and do the installation remotely.</li>
   <li><a href="#tarball">Tar file</a>: You can install from the tar file</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="network">1. Network mount</h3>

<p>You might be able to mount the DVD on one system and use network services to make it available on other systems.</p>

   <p class="l1"><span class="alarm">Please note that the SPEC CPU2006 license agreement does not allow you to post the DVD
   on any public server.</span>  If your institution has a SPEC CPU2006 license, then it's fine to post it on an internal
   server that is accessible only to members of your institution.</p>

<p class="snugbot">Whether you attempt a network mount will probably depend on:</p>
<ul>
<li>available network hardware,</li>
<li>the networking services provided by your operating system, and </li>
<li>the security policies of your IT department (if any).</li>
</ul>

<p class="snugtop">If your network environment allows easy cross-system mounting, or if you feel brave about reading
manpages, you can use a network mount for the installation.  Otherwise, you can fall back on <a style="white-space:nowrap;"
href="#tarball">the tar file</a>.</p>

<p><b>Network mount, easy:  <br />for example, System A Solaris/Opteron &nbsp;+&nbsp; System B Solaris/SPARC</b> </p>
<p class="l1">Your operating system may be configured to automatically mount the drive and automatically make it visible to
other network systems, or may make it visible with minimal user intervention.  During one set of testing, system A (with the
DVD drive) was an Opteron-based system running Solaris 10.  The SPEC CPU2006 DVD was inserted.  The operating system mounted
it automatically, and from a terminal window, a (non-privileged) user entered the Solaris <tt>share</tt> command 
to make it visible to other hosts.  </p>

<p class="l1">On System B, a Solaris SPARC system, a non-privileged user typed:</p>

<pre class="l2">cd /net/systemA/cdrom/spec_cpu2006
./install.sh</pre>

<p class="l1">and the installation proceeded normally, picking up from <a href="doinstall">step 5</a>, above.</p>

<p><b>Network mount, medium difficulty: <br />for example, System A Solaris/Opteron &nbsp;+&nbsp; System B Tru64 Unix/Alpha</b></p>

<p class="l1">Subsequent to the tests of the previous paragraphs, the DVD drive on System A (Solaris/Opteron) was also
visible to a system running Compaq Tru64 UNIX V5.1A.  But in this case, a little assistance was needed from the privileged
(root) account on system B:</p>
<pre class="l2">echo "systemA.domain.com:/cdrom/spec_cpu2006 /systemA nfs ro,bg,soft 0 0" &gt;&gt; /etc/fstab
mkdir /systemA
/usr/sbin/mount /systemA
</pre>
<p class="l1">Then, the non-privileged user was able to say:</p>
<pre class="l2">cd /systemA
./install.sh</pre>
<p class="l1">and once again the installation proceeded normally, picking up from <a href="doinstall">step 5</a>, above.</p>

<p><b>Network mount, a bit harder: <br />for example, System A SuSE/x86 &nbsp;+&nbsp; System B Mac OS X/PowerPC</b></p>

<p class="l1">The SPEC CPU2006 DVD was also inserted into a system running SuSE Linux 9.0, and used from a Mac OS X PowerBook.
On both these systems, there are probably automatic tools that would have accomplished the following more quickly, but the
tester happened to read the manpages in the particular order that he happened to read them in.  The following succeeded:</p>

<p class="l1">On System A, root added</p>
<pre class="l2">/dev/cdrom  /cd  iso9660  ro,user,noauto,unhide
</pre>
<p class="l1">to <tt>/etc/fstab</tt> as suggested by <span class="ttnobr">man mount</span>; the DVD was inserted; and the user typed
<tt>mount /cd</tt>.  On System A, root also added: </p>
<pre class="l2">/cd  192.168.0.0/24(ro,insecure,no_root_squash,sync)
</pre>
<p class="l1">to <tt>/etc/exports</tt>, and then typed:</p>
<pre class="l2">exportfs -r
rpc.nfsd -p 8
rpc.mountd
cat /var/lib/nfs/etab
</pre>
<p class="l1">On System B, root typed:</p>
<pre class="l2">mkdir /remote
mount -t nfs 192.168.0.106:/cd /remote
</pre>
<p class="l1">Finally, the user typed</p>
<pre class="l2">cd /remote
./install.sh
</pre>
<p class="l1">and installation continued as normal, with <a href="doinstall">step 5</a>.</p>


<h3 id="tarball">2. Tar file</h3>

<p>If the DVD drive is on a system other than the one where you wish to do the installation, and if you do not wish to try to
get a <a href="#network">network mount</a> working, then the final fallback is to use the compressed tarfile.  If you choose
this option, please carefully observe the <span class="alarm">warnings</span>.</p>

<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
<li><p>Go to the system with the DVD drive ("System A").  Insert the SPEC CPU2006 DVD, and, if required, issue a <a
href="#mount">mount</a> command.</p></li>

<li><p>From a terminal window (aka command window), <tt>cd</tt> to the top level directory on
the DVD.</p></li>

<li><p>You are going to retrieve five things from the DVD.  First, find the large tarfile and its corresponding md5 file:</p>

<pre class="l2">cd original.src 
ls -l cpu2006.tar.bz*
</pre>

<p>or, if System A is a Windows system, then:</p>

<pre class="l2">cd original.src 
dir cpu2006.tar.bz*
</pre>

<p>In either case, you should see one moderately large file &gt; 400MB, <tt>cpu2006.tar.bz2</tt>, and a small file associated
with it that contains a checksum, <tt>cpu2006.tar.bz2.md5</tt>.  </p>

<p class="commentary">If you don't see the above files, try looking for <tt>cpu*tar*</tt>.  The name might change if, for
example, a maintenance update of CPU2006 changes the name slightly to indicate an updated version.</p>

<p> Do whatever is required in order to transfer both files intact to the system where you wish to do the installation
("System B").  If you use <tt>ftp</tt>, <span class="alarm">do not forget to use image (binary) mode</span>.  For
example:</p>

<pre class="l2">
$ ftp
ftp&gt; <b>op systemB</b>
Name: <b>imauser</b>
Password:
ftp&gt; <b>cd /kits</b>
ftp&gt; <b>bin</b>   <span style="font-family:sans;" class="alarm">&lt;-------- important</span>
200 Type set to I.
ftp&gt; <b>put cpu2006.tar.bz2</b>
ftp&gt; <b>put cpu2006.tar.bz2.md5</b>
</pre>

<p><span class="alarm">Please note that the SPEC CPU2006 license agreement does not allow you to post the above file on any
public ftp server.</span>  If your institution has a SPEC CPU2006 license, then it's fine to post it on an internal server
that is accessible only to members of your institution.</p></li>

<li><p>Next, you are going to look on the DVD for versions of <tt>specbzip2</tt>, <tt>specmd5sum</tt>, and <tt>spectar</tt>
that are compatible with system B.  <span class="alarm">Please do not use the <tt>tar</tt> supplied by your operating
system</span> unless you are sure that it can handle long path names.  Many commonly-supplied <tt>tar</tt> utilities cannnot.
</p>

<p><span class="alarm">Please do not use Windows Zip utilities</span>, as these will not preserve line endings.</p>

<p>If you have GNU tar and the genuine bzip2, then you can use those; otherwise, please hunt around on the DVD to find
prebuilt versions that are compatible with your environment, like so:</p>

<pre>$ <b>cd /dvdrom</b>
$ <b>cd tools</b>
$ <b>cd bin</b>
$ <b>ls</b>

$ <b>cd aix5L-ppc </b>
$ <b>cat description </b>

$ <b>ls -l spec*</b>
-r-xr-xr-x   1 root     root      100596 Dec 20  2005 specbzip2

-r-xr-xr-x   1 root     root      285259 Dec 20  2005 spectar
$ 
</pre>

<p>Once you've found the right versions of <tt>specbzip2</tt>, <tt>specmd5sum</tt>,  and <tt>spectar</tt> for the system
where you intend to install (system B), transfer them to system B using the same methods that you used for the big
tarfile.</p></li>

<li><p>On system B, use <tt>specmd5sum</tt> to check that the file transfer worked correctly.  In this example, we assume that
you have placed all 5 of the files mentioned above in the <tt>/kits</tt> directory:</p> 
<pre>$ <b>cd /kits</b>
$ <b>specmd5sum -c cpu2006.tar.bz2.md5</b>
cpu2006.tar.bz2: OK
</pre></li>

<li><p>Unpack the tarfile, like so:</p>
<pre>$ <b>cd /mybigdisk</b>
$ <b>mkdir cpu2006</b>
$ <b>cd cpu2006</b>
$ <b>/kits/specbzip2 -dc /kits/cpu2006.tar.bz2 | /kits/spectar -xf -</b>
</pre>

<p>Be patient: it will take bit of time to unpack!  It might take 15 minutes, depending on the speed of your processor and
disks.  Go for a coffee break.</p></li>

<li><p>Now, at last, type <tt>./install.sh</tt> and pick up with <a href="#doinstall">step 5</a>, above.  Your output will
be similar, but not identical, to the output shown in step 5 above: you won't see the "Unpacking xxxx" messages, because you
already did the unpacking.</p></li>
