SPEC CPU2006 Benchmark Description</h1>

<h2>Benchmark Name</h2>
<p>998.specrand</p>
<hr />

<h2>Benchmark Author</h2>
<p>Cloyce D. Spradling &lt;cloyce+specrand &#x5b;at&#x5d; headgear.org&gt;</p>
<hr />

<h2>Benchmark Program General Category</h2>
<p>Mine Canary</p>
<hr />
 
<h2>Benchmark Description</h2>
<p>998.specrand is a small harness for the algorithm presented in
<a href="http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/63039.63042">"Random Number Generators:
Good Ones Are Hard To Find"</a> by Park and Miller.  The datatypes used have
been modified so that the algorithm will work properly on systems with
64-bit longs.</p>

<p>The benchmark simply generates a sequence of pseudorandom numbers starting
with a known seed.  This benchmark is not a timed component of CPU2006; rather,
it's there as an indicator of larger problems.  Several of the other benchmarks
use the specrand code as their PRNG.  Thus, a failure in 998.specrand would
point out a source of error in those codes as well.  This is cheap (in both
time and space) insurance.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Input Description</h2>
<p>998.specrand's input consists of two numbers: a seed value for the PRNG,
and a count of the numbers to generate.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Output Description</h2>
<p>The specified number of random numbers are generated and output twice.
The first set is unscaled output from the PRNG output as a standard floating
point number with no size or precision modifiers (printf '%f' format).  The
second set is scaled to between 1 and 2048000, and is output as a standard
integer with no size modifiers (printf '%d' format).  The PRNG is not re-seeded
between sequences, so actually count*2 numbers are generated.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Programming Language</h2>
<p>ANSI C</p>
<hr />

<h2>Known portability issues</h2>
<p>This code probably will not work on a system where the standard 'int' type
is 64-bits wide.</p>
