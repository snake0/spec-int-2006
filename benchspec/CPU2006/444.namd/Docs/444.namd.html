<h2>Benchmark Description</h2>

<p>The 444.namd benchmark is derived from the data layout and inner
loop of NAMD, a parallel program for the simulation of large
biomolecular systems.</p>

<p>Although NAMD was a winner of a 2002 Gordon Bell
award for parallel scalability, serial performance is equally
important to the over 10,000 users who have downloaded the program
over the past several years. Almost all of the runtime is
spent calculating inter-atomic interactions in a small set of
functions.  This set was separated from the bulk of the code to form
a compact benchmark for CPU2006. This computational core achieves
good performance on a wide range of machines, but contains no
platform-specific optimizations.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Input Description</h2>

<p>The file <tt>namd.input</tt> is a 92224 atom simulation of apolipoprotein
A-I and is used as a standard NAMD benchmark. This particular file
format is created by NAMD 2.5 using the "dumpbench" command, and
eliminates the need for file readers and other setup code from the
benchmark. Test, train and ref read from the same input file, but run
the code for different number of iterations. For ref the code is run
for 38 iterations.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Output Description</h2>

<p>CPU2006 uses the "<tt>--output namd.out</tt>" command-line option
to produce an output file, <tt>namd.out</tt>,
containing various checksums on the force calculations. These should
be consistent across platforms, within roundoff error, and it is used for
validation. </p>


<hr />

<h2>Programming Language</h2>

<p>C++</p>

<hr />

<h2>Known portability issues</h2>

<p>The benchmark is written in conservative C++, is quite portable,
and the inner loop code (module <tt>ComputeNonbondedUtil.C</tt>) contains no
aliasing. The erfc() function is required for startup. On Windows,
<span style="white-space:nowrap; font-family:monospace;">-DWIN32ERFC</span> 
is defined during compilation to build a version
of erfc() for little-endian, 32-bit and 64-bit platforms. This is only
needed for startup, and should not affect overall performance.</p>
