The apoa1 input is based on an old model of a high density lipoprotein
particle, comprising two apolipoprotein A-I molecules, 160 POPC lipids,
and water for a total of 92224 atoms in a 109x109x78A periodic cell, using
the CHARMM 22 force field, particle mesh Ewald full electrostatics, a 12A
cutoff, and multiple timestepping.  This is decomposed into 144 regular
spatial domains whose atoms only interact with those in the same or
neighboring domains.

The input set is generated from NAMD by adding "dumpbench <filename>" to
the end of a config file (to be released).  This ensures a realistic
dataset and the performance of spec_namd tracks the real NAMD very well.

The benchmark calculates nonbonded interactions between these atoms, using
two sets (within domain or neighboring domains) of six functions (with and
without calculating energy for short-only, short-and-PME-separate, and
short-and-PME-merged).  Each iteration exercises all six versions, and
verifies several identities between them to test correctness even when a
standard file is not supplied for comparison.
