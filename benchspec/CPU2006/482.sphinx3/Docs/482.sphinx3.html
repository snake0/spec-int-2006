<h1>482.sphinx3<br />
SPEC CPU2006 Benchmark Description</h1>

<h2>Benchmark Name</h2>

<p>482.sphinx3</p>

<hr />

<h2>Benchmark Author</h2>

<p>Sphinx Speech Group, Carnegie Mellon University. Thank you
especially to CMU Researchers Evandro Gouevea, Arthur Chan, and
Richard Stern for their assistance to SPEC in creating this
version. Thanks also to Paul Lamere of Sun for timely consulting on
many porting questions.</p>

<h2>Benchmark Program General Category</h2>

<p>Speech Recognition</p>

<hr />

<h2>Benchmark Description</h2>

<p>Sphinx-3 is a widely known speech recognition system from
Carnegie Mellon University.</p>

<p>This description assumes that the reader has already seen the
<a href=
"http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/sphinx3/index.html">Sphinx 3
introduction</a>, which provides an excellent introduction to the
inputs, outputs, and operation of the code. (A copy of this file as
of mid-2005 is included in the SPEC CPU2006 kit, as
<tt>$SPEC/benchspec/CPU2006/482.sphinx3/Docs/sphinx3-intro-CMU.html</tt>.)</p>

<p>CMU supplies a program known as <tt>livepretend</tt>, which
decodes utterances in batch mode, but otherwise operates as if it
were decoding a live human. In particular, it starts from raw
audio, not from an intermediate (cepstra) format.</p>

<p>Although in real life IO efficiency is obviously important to
any speech recognition system, for SPEC CPU purposes we wish to
concentrate on the CPU-intensive portions of the task. Therefore,
<tt>main_live_pretend.c</tt> has been adapted as
<tt>spec_main_live_pretend.c</tt>, which reads all the inputs
during initialization and then processes them repeatedly with
different settings for the "beams" (the probabilities that are used
to prune the set of active hypotheses at each recognition
step).</p>

<hr />

<h2>Input Description</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/databases/an4/">AN4
Database from CMU</a> is used. The raw audio format files are used
in either big endian or little endian form (depending on the
current machine).</p>

<hr />

<h2>Output Description</h2>

<p>Correct recognition is determined by examination of which
utterances were recognized (see lines "FWDVIT" in the generated
.log files), as well as a trace of language and acoustic
scores.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Programming Language</h2>

<p>C</p>

<hr />

<h2>Known portability issues</h2>

<p>None</p>
