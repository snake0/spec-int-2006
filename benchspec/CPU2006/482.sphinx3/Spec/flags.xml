<![CDATA[
<p>These are flags that appear in the benchmark sources, categorized as to
whether they are portability candidates, mandatory, or forbidden.

</header>

<flag name="currdir_inc" class="mandatory" regexp="-I(?:\.|libutil)(?:\s+|$)">
<example>-I., -Ilibutil</example>
This flag is included automatically by Spec/object.pm.
</flag>

<flag name="DHAVE_CONFIG_H" class="mandatory">
<example>-DHAVE_CONFIG_H</example>
This flag is included automatically by Spec/object.pm.
</flag>

<flag name="DCONT_AD_DEBUG" class="forbidden">
This flag, although potentially useful for debugging, is 
forbidden in an actual SPEC run.
</flag>

<flag name="DCONT_AD_RAWDUMP" class="forbidden">
This flag, although potentially useful for debugging, is 
forbidden in an actual SPEC run.
</flag>

<flag name="DE_ABORT" class="forbidden">
This flag, although potentially useful for debugging, is 
forbidden in an actual SPEC run.
</flag>

<flag name="DM_PI" class="forbidden">
The mathematical constant pi.  It seems unlikely that it would 
be useful to redefine this constant; doing so is therefore 
forbidden.
</flag>

<flag name="DSPEC_CPU" class="mandatory">
The SPEC version of sphinx has some additional output for 
validation (and also omits some output that is not needed.  The 
flag SPEC_CPU is therefore mandatory.
</flag>

<flag name="USPEC_CPU" class="forbidden">
The SPEC version of sphinx has some additional output for 
validation (and also omits some output that is not needed.  The 
flag SPEC_CPU is therefore mandatory.

<flag name="DSPEC_CPU_WINDOWS" class="mandatory">
Sphinx has various portability tweaks for Microsoft Windows, 
which must be used when testing on said platform.
</flag>

<flag name="DTEST" class="forbidden">
This flag, although potentially useful for debugging, is 
forbidden in an actual SPEC run.  It defines a main routine for 
testing purposes.
</flag>

<flag name="DTRUE" class="forbidden">
If you want to enter upon a philosophical (or political) quest 
in which you redefine the meaning of truth, please feel free; 
but it seems unlikely that the SPEC version of the Sphinx 
benchmark would be the right venue for this quest.  Therefore, 
please don't do so here.
</flag>

<flag name="DWIN32" class="forbidden">
For SPEC purposes, all needed portability items for Microsoft 
Windows have been collected under SPEC_CPU_WINDOWS.  As of 
11/2005, the only remaining uses of WIN32 are in code that is 
not enabled when SPEC_CPU is enabled; therefore, it should not 
be necessary to use this flag.

useful to allow it to be touched on the command line.
