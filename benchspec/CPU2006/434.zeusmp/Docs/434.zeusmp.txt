Benchmark Program General Category

Benchmark Description

   434.zeusmp is based on ZEUS-MP, a computational fluid dynamics code
   developed at the Laboratory for Computational Astrophysics (NCSA,
   University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign) for the simulation of
   astrophysical phenomena. ZEUS-MP solves problems in three spatial
   dimensions with a wide variety of boundary conditions.

   The program solves the equations of ideal (non-resistive),
   non-relativistic, hydrodynamics and magnetohydrodynamics, including
   externally applied gravitational fields and self-gravity. The gas can be
   adiabatic or isothermal, and the thermal pressure is isotropic. Boundary
   conditions may be specified as reflecting, periodic, inflow, or outflow.

   The physical problem solved in SPEC CPU2006 is a 3-D blastwave simulated
   with the presence of a uniform magnetic field along the x-direction. A
   Cartesian grid is used and the boundaries are "outflow."

   The original ZEUS-MP is based on ZEUS-3D and parallelized using the MPI
   message-passing library; for SPEC CPU2006, the MPI calls have been removed
   to create the single processor version 434.zeusmp.

Input Description

   The input file zmp_inp contains many parameters from which the problem is
   built, among them:

   mpitop
           The spatial arrangement of processors (irrelevant for CPU2006).

   rescon
           Restart control which is irrelevant in this test.

   pcon
           Problem control with the limits on number of steps (nlim) system
           time (tlim) and CPU time (cpulim).

   hycon
           Physical constants related to the hydrodynamical problem

   iib ~ okb
           Boundary conditions at the 6 boundaries.

   ggen1~3
           Grid information.

   grvcon
           Gravitation control which is irrelevant in this test.

   radcon
           Radiation control which is irrelevant in this test.

   radexp
           Radiative diffusion control which is irrelevant in this test.

   eqos
           Information on Equation of State.

   pgen
           Problem generator control information. In this test, it is a
           spherical blastwave with radius r=0.2 and located at the origin.
           The ambient density d0=1 and the ambient pressure is 0.6. The
           initial blastwave has density 100 times and pressure of 1 million
           times of the surrounding. B-field is in the x-direction (b10=140).

   gcon
           Moving grid control which is irrelevant in this test.

   iocon
           I/O control. Physical information of the blastwave test will ouput
           at the end of the run.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Output Description

   The output file "tsl000aa" contains physical information of the blastwave
   at the beginning and the end of the run. This file is used for validation.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Programming Language

   The main code is written in Fortran 77, with the change that (as in all of
   SPEC's Fortran benchmarks) the type

 DOUBLE PRECISION

   has been replaced by

 REAL*8

   thus making the size of the relevant floating-point data uniform across
   systems - an important consideration for fair benchmarking. While the type
   REAL*8 is not part of the strict Fortran 77 or Fortran 90 standards, it is
   a common language extension recognized by all Fortran compilers the SPEC
   CPU subcomittee has used in its tests.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Known portability issues

   None
