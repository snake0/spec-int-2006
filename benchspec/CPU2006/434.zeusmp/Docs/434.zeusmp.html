<h2>Benchmark Program General Category</h2>

<p>Physics / Magnetohydrodynamics</p>

<hr />

<h2>Benchmark Description</h2>

<p>434.zeusmp is based on ZEUS-MP, a computational fluid dynamics code developed at the
Laboratory for Computational Astrophysics (NCSA, University of
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign) for the simulation of astrophysical
phenomena.  ZEUS-MP solves
problems in three spatial dimensions with a wide variety of boundary
conditions. </p>

<p>The program solves the equations of ideal (non-resistive),
non-relativistic, hydrodynamics and magnetohydrodynamics, including
externally applied gravitational fields and self-gravity. The gas
can be adiabatic or isothermal, and the thermal pressure is
isotropic. Boundary conditions may be specified as reflecting,
periodic, inflow, or outflow.</p>

<p> The physical problem solved in SPEC CPU2006 is a 3-D blastwave
simulated with the presence of a uniform magnetic field along the
x-direction. A Cartesian grid is used and the boundaries are
"outflow."  </p>

<p>The original ZEUS-MP is based on ZEUS-3D and parallelized using the MPI
message-passing library; for SPEC CPU2006, the MPI calls have been
removed to create the single processor version 434.zeusmp.</p>

<h2>Input Description</h2>

<p>The input file zmp_inp contains many parameters from which the
problem is built, among them:</p>

<dl>
<dt>mpitop</dt>

<dd>The spatial arrangement of processors (irrelevant for CPU2006).</dd>

<dt>rescon</dt>

<dd>Restart control which is irrelevant in this test.</dd>

<dt>pcon</dt>

<dd>Problem control with the limits on number of steps (nlim)
system time (tlim) and CPU time (cpulim).</dd>

<dt>hycon</dt>

<dd>Physical constants related to the hydrodynamical problem</dd>

<dt>iib ~ okb</dt>

<dd>Boundary conditions at the 6 boundaries.</dd>

<dt>ggen1~3</dt>

<dd>Grid information.</dd>

<dt>grvcon</dt>

<dd>Gravitation control which is irrelevant in this test.</dd>

<dt>radcon</dt>

<dd>Radiation control which is irrelevant in this test.</dd>

<dt>radexp</dt>

<dd>Radiative diffusion control which is irrelevant in this
test.</dd>

<dt>eqos</dt>

<dd>Information on Equation of State.</dd>

<dt>pgen</dt>

<dd>Problem generator control information. In this test, it is a
spherical blastwave with radius r=0.2 and located at the origin.
The ambient density d0=1 and the ambient pressure is 0.6. The
initial blastwave has density 100 times and pressure of 1 million
times of the surrounding. B-field is in the x-direction
(b10=140).</dd>

<dt>gcon</dt>

<dd>Moving grid control which is irrelevant in this test.</dd>

<dt>iocon</dt>

<dd>I/O control. Physical information of the blastwave test will
ouput at the end of the run.</dd>
</dl>

<hr />

<h2>Output Description</h2>

<p>The output file "tsl000aa" contains physical information of the
blastwave at the beginning and the end of the run. This file is used
for validation.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Programming Language</h2>

<p>The main code is written in Fortran 77, with the change that (as
in all of SPEC's Fortran benchmarks) the type</p>

<pre>
DOUBLE PRECISION
</pre>

<p>has been replaced by</p>

<pre>
REAL*8
</pre>

<p>thus making the size of the relevant floating-point data uniform
across systems - an important consideration for fair benchmarking.
While the type REAL*8 is not part of the strict Fortran 77 or
Fortran 90 standards, it is a common language extension recognized
by all Fortran compilers the SPEC CPU subcomittee has used in its
tests.</p>

<h2>Known portability issues</h2>

<p>None</p>
