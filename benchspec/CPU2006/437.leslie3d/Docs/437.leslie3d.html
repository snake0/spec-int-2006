<h2>Benchmark Program General Category</h2>

<p>Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)</p>

<hr />

<h2>Benchmark Description</h2>

<p>437.leslie3d is derived from LESlie3d (<i>L</i>arge-<i>E</i>ddy <i>S</i>imulations with
<i>L</i>inear-<i>E</i>ddy Model in <i>3D</i>), a research-level
Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) code. It is the primary solver used
to investigate a wide array of turbulence phenomena such as mixing,
combustion, acoustics and general fluid mechanics. </p>

<p>For CPU2006, the program has
been set up a to solve a test problem which represents a subset of
such flows, namely the temporal mixing layer. This type of flow occurs in the
mixing regions of all combustors that employ fuel injection (which is
nearly all combustors). Also, this sort of mixing layer is a benchmark
problem used to understand physics of turbulent mixing. </p>

<p>LESlie3d uses a strongly-conservative, finite-volume algorithm with
the MacCormack Predictor-Corrector time integration scheme. The
accuracy is fourth-order spatially and second-order temporally.</p>

<p>The benchmark version, 437.leslie3d, performs limited file I/O to
isolate the workload to CPU and memory subsystems. A theoretically
exact problem was choosen for this benchmark to allow direct
validation.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Input Description</h2>

<p>Three different input stack sizes, test, train, ref, are available
for this benchmark. Each size represents an increasing grid resolution
for the solution. Input parameters include the grid size, flow
parameters and boundary conditions. 
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Output Description</h2>

<p>The output for the benchmark is a single text file, leslie3d.out, 
with analysis information that tracks the momentum thickness through time, 
which is validated against the provided theoretical data.</p>

<p>The original LESlie3D also writes to the screen; this code has been 
turned off for the SPEC version, 437.leslie3d.</p>

<h2>Programming Language</h2>

<p>Fortran 90</p>

<hr />

<h2>Known portability issues</h2>

<p>None known.</p>
