SPEC CPU2006 Benchmark Description</h1>

<h2>Benchmark Name</h2>

<p>481.wrf</p>

<hr />

<h2>Benchmark Author</h2>

<p>National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in collaboration
with multiple government agencies, universities, and others.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Benchmark Program General Category</h2>

<p>Weather Forecasting</p>

<hr />

<h2>Benchmark Description</h2>

<p>481.wrf is based on the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model, which is a
next-generation mesocale numerical weather prediction system designed
to serve both operational forecasting and atmospheric research
needs. </p>

<p>WRF features multiple dynamical cores, a 3-dimensional
variational (3DVAR) data assimilation system, and a software
architecture allowing for computational parallelism and system
extensibility. The parallel portions of the code have been
turned off for SPEC CPU2006 as the interest here is in single
processor performance. </p>

<p>WRF is suitable for a broad spectrum of
applications across scales ranging from meters to thousands of
kilometers.</p>

<p>WRF version 2.0.2 is used in the benchmark version, 481.wrf.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Input Description</h2>

<p>The WRF Standard Initialization (SI) software is used to create
the data sets. The June 2001 SI data archived at
NCAR is used as data sets. The data is 10 km from 1200 UTC June 11 -
1200 UTC Jun 12 2001 at 3 h interval.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Output Description</h2>

<p>The temperature at a certain grid point is printed for every
time step and validated.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Programming Language</h2>

<p>Fortran 90 and C</p>

<hr />

<h2>Known portability issues</h2>

<p>481.wrf requires the netCDF library for I/O. netCDF is packaged as
part of the source, but may need to be configured for your system.  
SPEC_CPU portability options are provided.</p>

<p>481.wrf uses unformatted I/O to read its data files.  By default, files
with 4-byte headers will be read.  If your system requires 8-byte headers,
please set</p>
<pre>
  wrf_data_header_size = 8
</pre>
<p>in the 481.wrf section of your config file.</p>
