<h2>Benchmark Name</h2>

<p>462.libquantum</p>

<hr />

<h2>Benchmark Author</h2>

<p>Bj&ouml;rn Butscher, Hendrik Weimer &lt;libquantum &#x5b;at&#x5d; enyo.de&gt;</p>

<hr />

<h2>Benchmark Program General Category</h2>

<p>Physics / Quantum Computing</p>

<hr />

<h2>Benchmark Description</h2>

<p>libquantum is a library for the simulation of a quantum
computer. Quantum computers are based on the principles of quantum
mechanics and can solve certain computationally hard tasks in
polynomial time. In 1994, Peter Shor discovered a polynomial-time
algorithm for the factorization of numbers, a problem of particular
interest for cryptanalysis, as the widely used RSA cryptosystem
depends on prime factorization being a problem only to be solvable
in exponential time. An implementation of Shor's factorization
algorithm is included in libquantum.</p>

<p>libquantum provides a structure for representing a quantum
register and some elementary gates. Measurements can be used to
extract information from the system. Additionally, libquantum
offers the simulation of decoherence, the most important obstacle
in building practical quantum computers. It is thus not only
possible to simulate any quantum algorithm, but also to develop
quantum error correction algorithms. As libquantum allows to add
new gates, it can easily be extended to fit the ongoing research,
e.g. it has been deployed to analyze quantum cryptography.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Input Description</h2>

<p>The benchmark program expects the number to be factorized as a
command-line parameter. An additional parameter can be supplied to
specify a base for the modular exponentiation part of Shor's
algorithm.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Output Description</h2>

<p>The program gives a brief explanation on what it is doing and
the factors of the input number if the factorization was
successful.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Programming Language</h2>

<p>ISO/IEC 9899:1999 ("C99")</p>

<hr />

<h2>Known portability issues</h2>

<ul>
<li>On Solaris prior to version 10, <tt>/usr/include/complex.h</tt>
is not available, causing error messages such as:

<pre>
   "config.h", line 19: cannot find include file: &lt;complex.h&gt;
   
</pre>
You can work around this by including <kbd>-I. -lcplxsupp</kbd> in
your compilation flags.</li>
</ul>
