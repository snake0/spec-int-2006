Benchmark Description

   libquantum is a library for the simulation of a quantum computer. Quantum
   computers are based on the principles of quantum mechanics and can solve
   certain computationally hard tasks in polynomial time. In 1994, Peter Shor
   discovered a polynomial-time algorithm for the factorization of numbers, a
   problem of particular interest for cryptanalysis, as the widely used RSA
   cryptosystem depends on prime factorization being a problem only to be
   solvable in exponential time. An implementation of Shor's factorization
   algorithm is included in libquantum.

   libquantum provides a structure for representing a quantum register and
   some elementary gates. Measurements can be used to extract information
   from the system. Additionally, libquantum offers the simulation of
   decoherence, the most important obstacle in building practical quantum
   computers. It is thus not only possible to simulate any quantum algorithm,
   but also to develop quantum error correction algorithms. As libquantum
   allows to add new gates, it can easily be extended to fit the ongoing
   research, e.g. it has been deployed to analyze quantum cryptography.

Input Description

   The benchmark program expects the number to be factorized as a
   command-line parameter. An additional parameter can be supplied to specify
   a base for the modular exponentiation part of Shor's algorithm.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Output Description

   The program gives a brief explanation on what it is doing and the factors
   of the input number if the factorization was successful.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Programming Language

   ISO/IEC 9899:1999 ("C99")

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Known portability issues

     * On Solaris prior to version 10, /usr/include/complex.h is not
       available, causing error messages such as:

    "config.h", line 19: cannot find include file: <complex.h>
   

       You can work around this by including -I. -lcplxsupp in your
       compilation flags.
