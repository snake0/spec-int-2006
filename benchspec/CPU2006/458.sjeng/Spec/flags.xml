<p>These are flags that appear in the benchmark sources, categorized as to
whether they are portability candidates, mandatory, or forbidden.

<flag name="DFTIME" class="forbidden">
This flag is forbidden because in the context of SPEC CPU, time 
is measured by the SPEC harness, rather than by the benchmark itself.
</flag>

<flag name="DGETTICKCOUNT" class="forbidden">
This flag is forbidden because in the context of SPEC CPU, time 
is measured by the SPEC harness, rather than by the benchmark itself.
</flag>

<flag name="DGETTIMEOFDAY" class="forbidden">
This flag is forbidden because in the context of SPEC CPU, time 
is measured by the SPEC harness, rather than by the benchmark itself.
</flag>

<flag name="DINPROBECODE" class="forbidden">
It seems likely that setting this flag would break the build; 
in any case, it's untested, and forbidden in a SPEC run.
</flag>

<flag name="DPN2" class="forbidden">
If set, this would cause sjeng to search by a quite different 
method than the one used in the SPEC benchmark.
</flag>

<flag name="DPROTOS_H" class="forbidden">
This flag is used to prohibit multiple includes of a header 
file.  Explicitly defining this flag would presumably break the 
build; setting this flag on the command-line during compile is 
therefore forbidden. 
</flag>

<flag name="DSJENG_H" class="forbidden">
This flag is used to prohibit multiple includes of a header 
file.  Explicitly defining this flag would presumably break the 
build; setting this flag on the command-line during compile is 
therefore forbidden. 
</flag>

<flag name="Dmax" class="forbidden">
max and min are macros defined in sjeng.h; defining them on the 
command line would presumabbly break the build, so they are 
forbidden.
</flag>

<flag name="Dmin" class="forbidden">
max and min are macros defined in sjeng.h; defining them on the 
command line would presumabbly break the build, so they are 
forbidden.
</flag>
