<h2>Benchmark Name</h2>

<p>458.sjeng</p>

<hr />

<h2>Benchmark Authors</h2>

<h2>Benchmark Program General Category</h2>

<p>Artificial Intelligence (game tree search &amp; pattern
recognition)</p>

<hr />

<h2>Benchmark Description</h2>

<p>458.sjeng is based on Sjeng 11.2, which is a program that 
plays chess and several chess variants,
such as drop-chess (similar to Shogi), and 'losing' chess. </p>

<p>It
attempts to find the best move via a combination of alpha-beta or
priority proof number tree searches, advanced move ordering,
positional evaluation and heuristic forward pruning. Practically,
it will explore the tree of variations resulting from a given
position to a given base depth, extending interesting variations
but discarding doubtful or irrelevant ones. From this tree the
optimal line of play for both players ("principle variation") is
determined, as well as a score reflecting the balance of power
between the two.</p>

<p>
The SPEC version is an enhanced version of the free Sjeng 11.2
program, modified to be more portable and more accurately reflect
the workload of current professional programs.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Input Description</h2>

<p>458.sjeng's input consists of a textfile containing alternations
of</p>

<ol>
<li>a chess position in the standard Forsyth-Edwards Notation
(FEN)</li>

<li>the depth to which this position should be analyzed, in
half-moves (ply depth)</li>
</ol>

<p>The SPEC reference input consists of 9 positions belonging to
various phases of the game.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Output Description</h2>

<p>458.sjeng's output consists, per position, of some side
information (textual display of the chessboard, phase of the game,
used parameters...) followed by the output from the tree searching
module as it progresses. This is formatted as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Attained depth in half-moves (plies)</li>

<li>Score for the player that is to move, in equivalents of 1
pawn</li>

<li>Number of positions investigated</li>

<li>The optimal line of play ("principle variation")</li>
</ol>

<hr />

<h2>Programming Language</h2>

<p>ANSI C</p>

<hr />

<h2>Known portability issues</h2>

<p>Requires that "<tt>int</tt>" is at least 32 bits wide.</p>
