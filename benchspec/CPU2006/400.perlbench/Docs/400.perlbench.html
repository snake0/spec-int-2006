SPEC CPU2006 Benchmark Description</h1>

<h2>Benchmark Name</h2>
<p>400.perlbench</p>

<hr />

<h2>Benchmark Authors</h2>

<p>Larry Wall, et. al.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Benchmark Program General Category</h2>

<p>Programming language</p>

<hr />

<h2>Benchmark Description</h2>

  <p>400.perlbench is a cut-down version of Perl v5.8.7, the popular scripting
  language.  SPEC's version of Perl has had most of OS-specific features
  removed.  In addition to the core Perl interpreter, several third-party
  modules are used:</p>
  <ul>
          <li>SpamAssassin v2.61</li>
          <li>Digest-MD5 v2.33</li>
          <li>HTML-Parser v3.35</li>
	  <li>MHonArc v2.6.8</li>
	  <li>IO-stringy v1.205</li>
	  <li>MailTools v1.60</li>
	  <li>TimeDate v1.16</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Sources for all of the freely-available components used in 400.perlbench can
  be found in $SPEC/original.src/400.perlbench.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Input Description</h2>

  <p>The reference workload for 400.perlbench consists of three scripts:</p>
  <ul>

   <li>The primary component of the workload is the Open Source spam checking
   software SpamAssassin.  SpamAssassin is used to score a couple of known
   corpora of both spam and ham (non-spam), as well as a sampling of mail
   generated from a set of random components.  SpamAssassin has been
   heavily patched to avoid doing file I/O, and currently (8/31/2004) does
   not use the Bayesian filtering.</li>

   <li>Another component is the popular freeware email-to-HTML converter
   MHonArc.  Email messages are generated randomly and converted to HTML.
   In addition to MHonArc, which was lightly patched to avoid file I/O,
   this component also uses several standard modules from the CPAN
   (Comprehensive Perl Archive Network).</li>

   <li>The third script (which also uses the mail generator for convienience)
   excercises a slightly-modified version of the 'specdiff' script, which
   is a part of the CPU2006 tool suite.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The training workload is similar, but not identical, to the reference
  workload from CPU2000.  The test workload consists of the non-system-
  specific parts of the actual Perl 5.8.7 test harness.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Output Description</h2>

  <p>In the case of the mail-based benchmarks, a line with salient
  characteristics (number of header lines, number of body lines, etc) is
  output for each message generated.  During processing, MD5 hashes of the
  contents of output "files" (in memory) are computed and output.  For
  SpamAssassin, the message's score and the rules that it triggered are
  also output.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Programming Language</h2>

<p>ANSI C</p>

<hr />

<h2>Known portability issues</h2>

  <p>There are some known aliasing issues.  The internal data
  structures that represent Perl's variables are accessed in such as a way
  as to violate ANSI aliasing rules.  Compilation with optimizations that
  rely on strict compliance to ANSI C aliasing rules will most likely
  produce binaries that will not validate.</p>
