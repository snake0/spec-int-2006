This directory contains some platform-specific config.h files.  If you're
trying to port 447.dealII, it might be helpful to take a look in one for
a platform similar to yours in order to get some hints.

Note that the SPEC version does not actually use these config files: SPEC 
attempts to minimize the platform differences.  So, take these with a grain
of salt, and look at actual submissions at www.spec.org/cpu2006 to see what
is actually being used for deal flags.
