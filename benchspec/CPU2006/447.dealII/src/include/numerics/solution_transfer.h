/**
 * Transfers a discrete FE function (like a solution vector) by interpolation
 * while refining and/or coarsening a grid. During interpolation the
 * vector is reinitialized to the new size and filled with the interpolated
 * values.
 * 
 * @sect3{Usage}
 *
 * As the interpolation while
 * coarsening is much more complicated to organize 
 * (see further documentation below) than interpolation while pure refinement,
 * @p SolutionTransfer offers two possible usages.
 * <ul>
 * <li> If the grid will only be purely refined
 * (i.e. not locally coarsened) then use @p SolutionTransfer as follows
 * @verbatim
 * SolutionTransfer<dim, double> soltrans(*dof_handler);
 *                                     // flag some cells for refinement, e.g.
 * GridRefinement::refine_and_coarsen_fixed_fraction(
 *   *tria, error_indicators, 0.3, 0);
 *                                     // prepare the triangulation
 *                                     // for refinement,
 * tria->prepare_coarsening_and_refinement();
 *                                     // tell the SolutionTransfer object
 *                                     // that we intent to do pure refinement,
 * soltrans.prepare_for_pure_refinement();
 *                                     // actually execute the refinement,
 * tria->execute_coarsening_and_refinement();
 *                                     // and redistribute dofs.
 * dof_handler->distribute_dofs (fe);
 * @endverbatim
 *
 * Then there are three different possibilities of how to proceed. Either
 * @verbatim
 *                                     // resize and interpolate a solution
 *                                     // vector `in-place'
 * soltrans.refine_interpolate(solution);
 * @endverbatim
 * or, when the old solution vector is still needed,
 * @verbatim
 *                                     // take a copy of the solution vector
 * Vector<double> solution_old(solution);
 *                                     // resize solution vector to the correct
 *                                     // size, as the @p refine_interpolate
 *                                     // function requires the vectors to be
 *                                     // of right sizes
 * solution.reinit(dof_handler->n_dofs());
 *                                     // and finally interpolate
 * soltrans.refine_interpolate(solution_old, solution);
 * @endverbatim
 *
 * Although the @p refine_interpolate functions are allowed to be
 * called multiple times, e.g. for interpolating several solution
 * vectors, there is following possibility of interpolating several
 * functions simultaneously.
 * @verbatim
 * vector<Vector<double> > solutions_old(n_vectors, Vector<double> (n));
 * ...
 * vector<Vector<double> > solutions(n_vectors, Vector<double> (n));
 * soltrans.refine_interpolate(solutions_old, solutions);
 * @endverbatim
 * <li> If the grid will be refined AND coarsened
 * then use @p SolutionTransfer as follows
 * @verbatim
 * SolutionTransfer<dim, double> soltrans(*dof_handler);
 *                                     // flag some cells for refinement
 *                                     // and coarsening, e.g.
 * GridRefinement::refine_and_coarsen_fixed_fraction(
 *   *tria, error_indicators, 0.3, 0.05);
 *                                     // prepare the triangulation,
 * tria->prepare_coarsening_and_refinement();
 *                                     // prepare the SolutionTransfer object
 *                                     // for coarsening and refinement and give
 *                                     // the solution vector that we intent to
 *                                     // interpolate later,
 * soltrans.prepare_for_coarsening_and_refinement(solution);
 *                                     // actually execute the refinement,
 * tria->execute_coarsening_and_refinement ();
 *                                     // redistribute dofs,
 * dof_handler->distribute_dofs (fe);
 *                                     // and interpolate the solution
 * Vector<double> interpolate_solution(dof_handler->n_dofs());
 * soltrans.interpolate(solution, interpolated_solution);
 * @endverbatim
 *
 * Multiple calls to the function 
 * <tt>interpolate (const Vector<number> &in, Vector<number> &out)</tt>
 * are NOT allowed. Interpolating several functions can be performed in one step
 * by using 
 * <tt>void interpolate (const vector<Vector<number> >&all_in, vector<Vector<number> >&all_out) const</tt>,
 * and using the respective @p prepare_for_coarsening_and_refinement function 
 * taking several vectors as input before actually refining and coarsening the
 * triangulation (see there).
 * </ul>
 *
 * For deleting all stored data in @p SolutionTransfer and reinitializing it
 * use the <tt>clear()</tt> function.
 *
 * Note that the @p user_pointer of some cells are used. 
 * Be sure that you don't need them otherwise.
 *
 * The template argument @p number denotes the data type of the vectors you want
 * to transfer.
 *
 *
 * @sect3{Implementation}
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li> Solution transfer while pure refinement. Assume that we have got a
 * solution vector on the current (original) grid.
 * Each entry of this vector belongs to one of the
 * DoFs of the discretisation. If we now refine the grid then the calling of
 * DoFHandler::distribute_dofs() will change at least some of the
 * DoF indices. Hence we need to store the DoF indices of all active cells
 * before the refinement. The @p user_pointer of each active cell
 * is used to point to the vector of these DoF indices of that cell, all other
 * @p user_pointers are cleared. All this is
 * done by prepare_for_pure_refinement().
 *
 * In the function <tt>refine_interpolate(in,out)</tt> and on each cell where the
 * @p user_pointer is set (i.e. the cells that were active in the original grid)
 * we can now access the local values of the solution vector @p in
 * on that cell by using the stored DoF indices. These local values are
 * interpolated and set into the vector @p out that is at the end the
 * discrete function @p in interpolated on the refined mesh.
 *
 * The <tt>refine_interpolate(in,out)</tt> function can be called multiply for
 * arbitrary many discrete functions (solution vectors) on the original grid. 
 *
 * <li> Solution transfer while coarsening and refinement. After 
 * calling Triangulation@p ::prepare_coarsening_and_refinement the
 * coarsen flags of either all or none of the children of a 
 * (father-)cell are set. While coarsening 
 * (Triangulation@p ::execute_coarsening_and_refinement)
 * the cells that are not needed any more will be deleted from the Triangulation.
 * 
 * For the interpolation from the (to be coarsenend) children to their father
 * the children cells are needed. Hence this interpolation
 * and the storing of the interpolated values of each of the discrete functions
 * that we want to interpolate needs to take place before these children cells
 * are coarsened (and deleted!!). Again the @p user_pointers of the cells are
 * set to point to these values (see below). 
 * Additionally the DoF indices of the cells
 * that will not be coarsened need to be stored according to the solution
 * transfer while pure refinement (cf there). All this is performed by
 * <tt>prepare_for_coarsening_and_refinement(all_in)</tt> where the 
 * <tt>vector<Vector<number> >vector all_in</tt> includes
 * all discrete functions to be interpolated onto the new grid.
 *
 * As we need two different kinds of pointers (<tt>vector<unsigned int> *</tt> for the Dof
 * indices and <tt>vector<Vector<number> > *</tt> for the interpolated DoF values)
 * we use the @p Pointerstruct that includes both of these pointers and
 * the @p user_pointer of each cell points to these @p Pointerstructs. 
 * On each cell only one of the two different pointers is used at one time 
 * hence we could use the
 * <tt>void * user_pointer</tt> as <tt>vector<unsigned int> *</tt> at one time and as 
 * <tt>vector<Vector<number> > *</tt> at the other but using this @p Pointerstruct
 * in between makes the use of these pointers more safe and gives better
 * possibility to expand their usage.
 * 
 * In <tt>interpolate(all_in, all_out)</tt> the refined cells are treated according
 * to the solution transfer while pure refinement. Additionally, on each
 * cell that is coarsened (hence previously was a father cell), 
 * the values of the discrete
 * functions in @p all_out are set to the stored local interpolated values 
 * that are accessible due to the 'vector<Vector<number> > *' pointer in 
 * @p Pointerstruct that is pointed to by the @p user_pointer of that cell.
 * It is clear that <tt>interpolate(all_in, all_out)</tt> only can be called with
 * the <tt>vector<Vector<number> > all_in</tt> that previously was the parameter
 * of the <tt>prepare_for_coarsening_and_refinement(all_in)</tt> function. Hence 
 * <tt>interpolate(all_in, all_out)</tt> can (in contrast to 
 * <tt>refine_interpolate(in, out)</tt>) only be called once.
 * </ul>
