/**
 * This class generates output in the full domain of computations that
 * were done using rotational symmetry of domain and solution. In
 * particular, if a computation of a three dimensional problem with
 * rotational symmetry around the @p z-axis (i.e. in the
 * @p r-z-plane) was done, then this class can be used to generate
 * the output in the original @p x-y-z space. In order to do so, it
 * generates from each cell in the computational mesh a cell in the
 * space with dimension one greater than that of the DoFHandler
 * object. The resulting output will then consist of hexahedra forming
 * an object that has rotational symmetry around the z-axis. As most
 * graphical programs can not represent ring-like structures, the
 * angular (rotation) variable is discretized into a finite number of
 * intervals as well; the number of these intervals must be given to
 * the @p build_patches function. It is noted, however, that while
 * this function generates nice pictures of the whole domain, it often
 * produces <em>very</em> large output files.
 *
 *
 * @sect3{Interface}
 *
 * The interface of this class is copied from the DataOut
 * class. Furthermore, they share the common parent class
 * DataOut_DoFData(). See the reference of these two classes for a
 * discussion of the interface and how to extend it by deriving
 * further classes from this class.
 *
 *
 * @sect3{Details for 1d computations}
 *
 * The one coordinate in the triangulation used by the
 * DoFHandler object passed to this class is taken as the radial
 * variable, and the output will then be either a circle or a ring
 * domain. It is in the user's responsibility to assure that the
 * radial coordinate only attains non-negative values.
 *
 *
 * @sect3{Details for 2d computations}
 *
 * We consider the computation (represented by the DoFHandler
 * object that is attached to this class) to have happened in the
 * @p r-z-plane, where @p r is the radial variable and @p z denotes
 * the axis of revolution around which the solution is symmetric. The
 * output is in @p x-y-z space, where the radial dependence is
 * transformed to the @p x-y plane. At present, it is not possible to
 * exchange the meaning of the first and second variable of the plane
 * in which the simulation was made, i.e. generate output from a
 * simulation where the first variable denoted the symmetry axis, and
 * the second denoted the radial variable. You have to take that into
 * account when first programming your application.
 *
 * It is in the responsibility of the user to make sure that the
 * radial variable attains only non-negative values.
