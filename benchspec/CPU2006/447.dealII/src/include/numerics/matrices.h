/**
 * Provide a class which assembles certain standard matrices for a
 * given triangulation, using a given finite element, a given mapping
 * and a quadrature formula.  All functions are static, so it is not
 * necessary to create an object of this type, though you may do so.
 *
 *
 * @sect3{Conventions for all functions}
 *
 * There exist two versions of each function. One with a Mapping
 * argument and one without. If a code uses a mapping different from
 * MappingQ1 the functions <em>with</em> mapping argument should
 * be used. Code that uses only MappingQ1 may also use the
 * functions <em>without</em> Mapping argument. Each of these
 * latter functions create a MappingQ1 object and just call the
 * respective functions with that object as mapping argument. The
 * functions without Mapping argument still exist to ensure
 * backward compatibility. Nevertheless it is advised to change the
 * user's codes to store a specific Mapping object and to use
 * the functions that take this @p Mapping object as argument. This
 * gives the possibility to easily extend the user codes to work also
 * on mappings of higher degree, this just by exchanging
 * MappingQ1 by, for example, a MappingQ or another
 * Mapping object of interest.
 *
 * All functions take a sparse matrix object to hold the matrix to be
 * created. The functions assume that the matrix is initialized with a
 * sparsity pattern (SparsityPattern) corresponding to the given degree
 * of freedom handler, i.e. the sparsity structure is already as needed.
 * You can do this by calling the DoFTools::make_sparsity_pattern()
 * function.
 *
 * Furthermore it is assumed that no relevant data is in the matrix. All
 * entries will be overwritten. Entries which are not needed by the matrix
 * are not touched and in special are not set to zero.
 * In all cases, the elements of the matrix to be assembled are simply
 * summed up from the contributions of each cell. Therefore you may want
 * to clear the matrix before assemblage.
 *
 * All created matrices are `raw': they are not condensed,
 * i.e. hanging nodes are not eliminated. The reason is that you may
 * want to add several matrices and could then condense afterwards
 * only once, instead of for every matrix. To actually do computations
 * with these matrices, you have to condense the matrix using the
 * ConstraintMatrix@p ::condense function; you also have to
 * condense the right hand side accordingly and distribute the
 * solution afterwards.
 *
 * If you want to use boundary conditions with the matrices generated
 * by the functions of this class, you have to use a function like
 * <tt>ProblemBase<>::apply_dirichlet_bc</tt> to matrix and right hand
 * side.
 *
 *
 * @sect3{Supported matrices}
 *
 * At present there are functions to create the following matrices:
 * <ul>
 * <li> @p create_mass_matrix: create the matrix with entries
 *   $m_{ij} = \int_\Omega \phi_i(x) \phi_j(x) dx$ by numerical
 *   quadrature. Here, the $\phi_i$ are the basis functions of the
 *   finite element space given.
 *
 *   A coefficient may be given to evaluate
 *   $m_{ij} = \int_\Omega a(x) \phi_i(x) \phi_j(x) dx$ instead.
 *
 * <li> @p create_laplace_matrix: create the matrix with entries
 *   $m_{ij} = \int_\Omega \nabla\phi_i(x) \nabla\phi_j(x) dx$ by
 *   numerical quadrature.
 *
 *   Again, a coefficient may be given to evaluate
 *   $m_{ij} = \int_\Omega a(x) \nabla\phi_i(x) \phi_j(x) dx$ instead.
 * </ul>
 *
 * Make sure that the order of the Quadrature formula given to these
 * functions is sufficiently high to compute the matrices with the
 * required accuracy. For the choice of this quadrature rule you need
 * to take into account the polynomial degree of the FiniteElement
 * basis functions, the roughness of the coefficient @p a, as well as
 * the degree of the given @p Mapping.
 *
 * Note, that for system elements the mass matrix and the laplace
 * matrix is implemented such that each components couples only with
 * itself. I.e. there is no coupling of shape functions belonging to
 * different components.
 *
 * If the finite element for which the mass matrix or the laplace
 * matrix is to be built has more than one component, this function
 * accepts a single coefficient as well as a vector valued coefficient
 * function. For the latter case make sure that the number of
 * components coincides with the number of components of the system
 * finite element.
 *
 *
 * @sect3{Matrices on the boundary}
 *
 * The @p create_boundary_mass_matrix creates the matrix with entries
 * $m_{ij} = \int_{\Gamma} \phi_i \phi_j dx$, where $\Gamma$ is the
 * union of boundary parts with indicators contained in a
 * FunctioMap@p ::FunctionMap passed to the function (i.e. if
 * you want to set up the mass matrix for the parts of the boundary
 * with indicators zero and 2, you pass the function a map of
 * <tt>unsigned char</tt>s as parameter @p boundary_functions containing
 * the keys zero and 2). The $\phi_i$ are the basis functions which
 * have at least part of their support on $\Gamma$. The mapping
 * @p dof_to_boundary_mapping required by this function maps global
 * DoF numbers to a numbering of the degrees of freedom located on the
 * boundary, and can be obtained using the function
 * @p DoFTools::map_dof_to_boundary_indices.
 *
 * Since in most cases we are not interested in the pure mass matrix on the
 * boundary, but rather need it to compute the projection of a function to
 * the boundary, no function is provided to only create the matrix.
 *
 * This function needs to get passed a matrix object to hold the resulting sparse
 * matrix. This object is supposed to be initialized with a suitable sparsity
 * pattern, which can be created using the
 * DoFHandler@p ::make_boundary_sparsity_pattern function.
 *
 * The object describing the exact form of the boundary is obtained from the
 * triangulation object.
 *
 *
 * @sect3{Right hand sides}
 *
 * In many cases, you will not only want to build the matrix, but also
 * a right hand side, which will give a vector with
 * $f_i = \int_\Omega f(x) \phi_i(x) dx$. For this purpose, each function
 * exists in two versions, one only building the matrix and one also
 * building the right hand side vector. If you want to create a right
 * hand side vector without creating a matrix, you can use the
 * VectorTools::create_right_hand_side() function. The use of the
 * latter may be useful if you want to create many right hand side
 * vectors.
 *
 * Creation of the right hand side is the same for all operators and
 * therefore for all of the functions below. It would be most
 * orthogonal to write one single function which builds up the right
 * hand side and not provide many functions doing the same
 * thing. However, this may result in a heavy performance penalty,
 * since then many values of a certain finite element have to be
 * computed twice, so it is more economical to implement it more than
 * once.
 *
 * All functions in this collection use the finite element given to
 * the DoFHandler object the last time that the degrees of
 * freedom were distributed on the triangulation.

/**
 * Provide a collection of functions operating on matrices. These include
 * the application of boundary conditions to a linear system of equations
 * and others.
 *
 *
 * @sect3{Boundary conditions}
 *
 * The apply_boundary_values() function inserts boundary conditions
 * into a system of equations.  To actually do this you have to
 * specify a list of degree of freedom indices along with the values
 * these degrees of freedom shall assume. To see how to get such a
 * list, see the discussion of the
 * VectorTools::interpolate_boundary_values function.
 *
 * There are two ways to incorporate fixed degrees of freedom such as boundary
 * nodes into a linear system, as discussed below.
 * 
 *
 * @sect3{Global elimination}
 *
 * In the first method, we first assemble the global linear system without
 * respect for fixed degrees of freedom, and in a second step eliminate them
 * again from the linear system. The inclusion into the assembly process is as
 * follows: when the matrix and vectors are set up, a list of nodes subject to
 * dirichlet bc is made and matrix and vectors are modified accordingly. This
 * is done by deleting all entries in the matrix in the line of this degree of
 * freedom, setting the main diagonal entry to a suitable positive value and
 * the right hand side element to a value so that the solution of the linear
 * system will have the boundary value at this node. To decouple the remaining
 * linear system of equations and to make the system symmetric again (at least
 * if it was before), one Gauss elimination step is performed with this line,
 * by adding this (now almost empty) line to all other lines which couple with
 * the given degree of freedom and thus eliminating all coupling between this
 * degree of freedom and others. Now the respective column also consists only
 * of zeroes, apart from the main diagonal entry. Alternatively, the functions
 * in this class take a boolean parameter that allows to omit this last step,
 * if symmetry of the resulting linear system is not required. Note that
 * usually even CG can cope with a non-symmetric linear system with this
 * particular structure.
 *
 * Finding which rows contain an entry in the column for which we are
 * presently performing a Gauss elimination step is either difficult
 * or very simple, depending on the circumstances. If the sparsity
 * pattern is symmetric (whether the matrix is symmetric is irrelevant
 * here), then we can infer the rows which have a nonzero entry in the
 * present column by looking at which columns in the present row are
 * nonempty. In this case, we only need to look into a fixed number of
 * rows and need not search all rows. On the other hand, if the
 * sparsity pattern is nonsymmetric, then we need to use an iterative
 * solver which can handle nonsymmetric matrices in any case, so there
 * may be no need to do the Gauss elimination anyway. In fact, this is
 * the way the function works: it takes a parameter
 * (@p elininate_columns) that specifies whether the sparsity pattern
 * is symmetric; if so, then the column is eliminated and the right
 * hand side is also modified accordingly. If not, then only the row
 * is deleted and the column is not touched at all, and all right hand
 * side values apart from the one corresponding to the present row
 * remain unchanged.
 *
 * If the sparsity pattern for your matrix is non-symmetric, you must
 * set the value of this parameter to @p false in any case, since then
 * we can't eliminate the column without searching all rows, which
 * would be too expensive (if @p N be the number of rows, and @p m the
 * number of nonzero elements per row, then eliminating one column is
 * an <tt>O(N*log(m))</tt> operation, since searching in each row takes
 * <tt>log(m)</tt> operations). If your sparsity pattern is symmetric, but
 * your matrix is not, then you might specify @p false as well. If your
 * sparsity pattern and matrix are both symmetric, you might want to
 * specify @p true (the complexity of eliminating one row is then
 * <tt>O(m*log(m))</tt>, since we only have to search @p m rows for the
 * respective element of the column). Given the fact that @p m is
 * roughly constant, irrespective of the discretization, and that the
 * number of boundary nodes is <tt>sqrt(N)</tt> in 2d, the algorithm for
 * symmetric sparsity patterns is <tt>O(sqrt(N)*m*log(m))</tt>, while it
 * would be <tt>O(N*sqrt(N)*log(m))</tt> for the general case; the latter
 * is too expensive to be performed.
 *
 * It seems as if we had to make clear not to overwrite the lines of
 * other boundary nodes when doing the Gauss elimination
 * step. However, since we reset the right hand side when passing such
 * a node, it is not a problem to change the right hand side values of
 * other boundary nodes not yet processed. It would be a problem to
 * change those entries of nodes already processed, but since the
 * matrix entry of the present column on the row of an already
 * processed node is zero, the Gauss step does not change the right
 * hand side. We need therefore not take special care of other
 * boundary nodes.
 * 
 * To make solving faster, we preset the solution vector with the
 * right boundary values. It it not clear whether the deletion of
 * coupling between the boundary degree of freedom and other dofs
 * really forces the corresponding entry in the solution vector to
 * have the right value when using iterative solvers, since their
 * search directions may contain components in the direction of the
 * boundary node. For this reason, we perform a very simple line
 * balancing by not setting the main diagonal entry to unity, but
 * rather to the value it had before deleting this line, or to the
 * first nonzero main diagonal entry if it is zero for some reason.
 * Of course we have to change the right hand side appropriately. This
 * is not a very good strategy, but it at least should give the main
 * diagonal entry a value in the right order of dimension, which makes
 * the solvution process a bit more stable. A refined algorithm would
 * set the entry to the mean of the other diagonal entries, but this
 * seems to be too expensive.
 *
 * In some cases, it might be interesting to solve several times with
 * the same matrix, but for different right hand sides or boundary
 * values. However, since the modification for boundary values of the
 * right hand side vector depends on the original matrix, this is not
 * possible without storing the original matrix somewhere and applying
 * the @p apply_boundary_conditions function to a copy of it each
 * time we want to solve. In that case, you can use the
 * FilteredMatrix class in the @p LAC sublibrary. There you can
 * also find a formal (mathematical) description of the process of
 * modifying the matrix and right hand side vectors for boundary
 * values.
 *
 *
 * @sect3{Local elimination}
 *
 * The second way of handling boundary values is to modify the local matrix
 * and vector contributions appropriately before transferring them into the
 * global sparse matrix and vector. This is what local_apply_boundary_values()
 * does. The advantage is that we save the call to the apply_boundary_values
 * function (which is expensive because it has to work on sparse data
 * structures). On the other hand, the local_apply_boundary_values() function
 * is called many times, even if we only have a very small number of fixed
 * boundary nodes.
 *
 * However, since we do not have access to the data structures of some sparse
 * matrix formats (e.g. the PETSc matrix classes), this may be the only way to
 * get rid of boundary nodes for these matrix formats. In general, this
 * function should not be a loss in efficiency over the global one.
