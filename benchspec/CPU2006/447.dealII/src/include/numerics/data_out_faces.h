/**
 * This class generates output from faces of a triangulation rather
 * than from cells, as do for example the DataOut and
 * DataOut_Rotation() classes. It might be used to generate output
 * only for the surface of the triangulation (this is the default of
 * this class), or for another arbitrary set of faces. The output of
 * this class is a set of patches (as defined by the class
 * DataOutBase::Patch()), one for each face for which output is to
 * be generated. These patches can then be written in several
 * graphical data formats by the functions of the underlying classes.
 *
 * @sect3{Interface}
 *
 * The interface of this class is copied from the DataOut
 * class. Furthermore, they share the common parent class
 * DataOut_DoFData(). See the reference of these two classes for a
 * discussion of the interface.
 *
 *
 * @sect3{Extending this class}
 *
 * The sequence of faces to generate patches from is generated in the
 * same way as in the DataOut class, see there for a description
 * of the respective interface. For obvious reasons, the functions
 * generating the sequence of faces which shall be used to generate
 * output, are called @p first_face and @p next_face in this class,
 * rather than @p first_cell and @p next_cell.
 *
 * Since we need to initialize objects of type FEValues with the
 * faces generated from these functions, it is not sufficient that
 * they only return face iterators. Rather, we need a pair of cell and
 * the number of the face, as the values of finite element fields need
 * not necessarily be unique on a face (think of discontinuous finite
 * elements, where the value of the finite element field depend on the
 * direction from which you approach a face, thus it is necessary to
 * use a pair of cell and face, rather than only a face
 * iterator). Therefore, this class defines a @p typedef which
 * creates a type @p FaceDescriptor that is an abbreviation for a
 * pair of cell iterator and face number. The functions @p first_face
 * and @p next_face operate on objects of this type.
 *
 * Extending this class might, for example, be useful if you only want
 * output from certain portions of the boundary, e.g. as indicated by
 * the boundary indicator of the respective faces. However, it is also
 * conceivable that one generates patches not from boundary faces, but
 * from interior faces that are selected due to other criteria; one
 * application might be to use only those faces where one component of
 * the solution attains a certain value, in order to display the
 * values of other solution components on these faces. Other
 * applications certainly exist, for which the author is not
 * imaginative enough.
