/**
 * Base class for all matrix classes that are implemented on top of the PETSc
 * matrix types. Since in PETSc all matrix types (i.e. sequential and
 * parallel, sparse, blocked, etc.)  are built by filling the contents of an
 * abstract object that is only referenced through a pointer of a type that is
 * independent of the actual matrix type, we can implement almost all
 * functionality of matrices in this base class. Derived classes will then only
 * have to provide the functionality to create one or the other kind of
 * matrix.
 *
 * The interface of this class is modeled after the existing
 * SparseMatrix class in deal.II. It has almost the same member
 * functions, and is often exchangable. However, since PETSc only supports a
 * single scalar type (either double, float, or a complex data type), it is
 * not templated, and only works with whatever your PETSc installation has
 * defined the data type @p PetscScalar to.
 *
 * Note that PETSc only guarantees that operations do what you expect if the
 * functions @p MatAssemblyBegin and @p MatAssemblyEnd have been called
 * after matrix assembly. Therefore, you need to call
 * SparseMatrix::compress() before you actually use the matrix. This also
 * calls @p MatCompress that compresses the storage format for sparse
 * matrices by discarding unused elements. PETSc allows to continue with
 * assembling the matrix after calls to these functions, but since there are
 * no more free entries available after that any more, it is better to only
 * call SparseMatrix::compress() once at the end of the assembly stage and
 * before the matrix is actively used.
