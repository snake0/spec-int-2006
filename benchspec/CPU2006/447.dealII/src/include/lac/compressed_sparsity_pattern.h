/**
 * This class acts as an intermediate form of the
 * SparsityPattern class. From the interface it mostly
 * represents a SparsityPattern object that is kept compressed
 * at all times. However, since the final sparsity pattern is not
 * known while constructing it, keeping the pattern compressed at all
 * times can only be achieved at the expense of either increased
 * memory or run time consumption upon use. The main purpose of this
 * class is to avoid some memory bottlenecks, so we chose to implement
 * it memory conservative, but the chosen data format is too unsuited
 * to be used for actual matrices. It is therefore necessary to first
 * copy the data of this object over to an object of type
 * SparsityPattern before using it in actual matrices.
 *
 * Another viewpoint is that this class does not need up front
 * allocation of a certain amount of memory, but grows as necessary.
 *
 *
 * @sect3{Rationale}
 *
 * When constructing the sparsity pattern of a matrix, you usually
 * first have to provide an empty sparsity pattern object with a fixed
 * maximal number of entries per row. To find out about this maximal
 * row length, one usually calls the function
 * DoFHandler@p ::max_couplings_per_dof which returns an
 * estimate for that quantity. While this estimate is usually quite
 * good in 2d and exact in 1d, it is often significantly too large in
 * 3d and especially for higher order elements. Furthermore, normally
 * only a small fraction of the rows of a matrix will end up having
 * the maximal number of nonzero entries per row (usually those nodes
 * adjacent to hanging nodes), most have much less. In effect, the
 * empty SparsityPattern object has allocated much too much
 * memory. Although this unnecessarily allocated memory is later freed
 * when SparsityPattern@p ::compress is called, this
 * overallocation has, with higher order elements and in 3d, sometimes
 * been so large that the program aborted due to lack of memory.
 *
 * This class therefore provides an alternative representation of a
 * sparsity pattern: we don't specify a maximal row length initially,
 * but store a set of column indices indicating possible nonzero
 * entries in the sparsity pattern for each row. This is very much
 * like the final "compressed" format used in the
 * SparsityPattern object after compression, but uses a less
 * compact memory storage format, since the exact number of entries
 * per row is only known a posteriori and since it may change (for the
 * SparsityPattern class, no more changes are allowed after
 * compressing it). We can therefore not store all the column indices
 * in a big array, but have to use a vector of sets. This can later be
 * used to actually initialize a SparsityPattern object with the
 * then final set of necessary indices.
 *
 *
 * @sect3{Interface}
 *
 * Since this class is intended as an intermediate replacement of the
 * SparsityPattern class, it has mostly the same interface, with
 * small changes where necessary. In particular, the add()
 * function, and the functions inquiring properties of the sparsity
 * pattern are the same.
 *
 *
 * @sect3{Usage}
 *
 * Use this class as follows:
 * @verbatim
 * CompressedSparsityPattern compressed_pattern (dof_handler.n_dofs());
 * DoFTools::make_sparsity_pattern (dof_handler,
 *                                  compressed_pattern);
 * constraints.condense (compressed_pattern);
 *
 * SparsityPattern sp;
 * sp.copy_from (compressed_pattern);
 * @endverbatim
