/**
 * Numerical vector of data.  For this class there are different types
 * of functions available. The first type of function mesures the norm
 * of the vector in order to mesure its length in a suitable norm. The
 * second type support the abgebraic operation for vectors. The third
 * und last type helps us to manipulate the components of the vector.
 * As opposed to the array of the C++ standard library called
 * @p vector (with a lowercase "v"), this class implements an element
 * of a vector space suitable for numerical computations.
 *
 *
 * @sect2{On template instantiations}
 *
 * Member functions of this class are either implemented in this file
 * or in a file of the same name with suffix ``.templates.h''. For the
 * most common combinations of the template parameters, instantiations
 * of this class are provided in a file with suffix ``.cc'' in the
 * ``source'' directory. If you need an instantiation that is not
 * listed there, you have to include this file along with the
 * corresponding ``.templates.h'' file and instantiate the respective
 * class yourself.
