 * Base class for all vector classes that are implemented on top of the PETSc
 * vector types. Since in PETSc all vector types (i.e. sequential and parallel
 * ones) are built by filling the contents of an abstract object that is only
 * referenced through a pointer of a type that is independent of the actual
 * vector type, we can implement almost all functionality of vectors in this
 * base class. Derived classes will then only have to provide the
 * functionality to create one or the other kind of vector.
 *
 * The interface of this class is modeled after the existing Vector
 * class in deal.II. It has almost the same member functions, and is often
 * exchangable. However, since PETSc only supports a single scalar type
 * (either double, float, or a complex data type), it is not templated, and
 * only works with whatever your PETSc installation has defined the data type
 * @p PetscScalar to.
 *
 * Note that PETSc only guarantees that operations do what you expect if the
 * functions @p VecAssemblyBegin and @p VecAssemblyEnd have been called
 * after vector assembly. Therefore, you need to call Vector::compress()
 * before you actually use the vector.
