/**
 * This class is a wrapper for linear systems of equations with simple
 * equality constraints fixing individual degrees of freedom to a
 * certain value such as when using Dirichlet boundary
 * values. Mathematically speaking, it is used to represent a system
 * of linear equations $Ax=b$ with the constraint that $B_D x = g_D$,
 * where $B_D$ is a rectangular matrix with exactly one $1$ in each
 * row, and these $1$s in those columns representing constrained
 * degrees of freedom (e.g. for Dirichlet boundary nodes, thus the
 * index $D$) and zeroes for all other diagonal entries, and $g_D$
 * having the requested nodal values for these constrained
 * nodes. Thus, the underdetermined equation $B_D x = g_D$ fixes only
 * the constrained nodes and does not impose any condition on the
 * others. We note that $B_D B_D^T = 1_D$, where $1_D$ is the identity
 * matrix with dimension as large as the number of constrained degrees
 * of freedom. Likewise, $B_D^T B_D$ is the diagonal matrix with
 * diagonal entries $0$ or $1$ that, when applied to a vector, leaves
 * all constrained nodes untouched and deletes all unconstrained ones.
 *
 * For solving such a system of equations, we first write down the
 * Lagrangian $L=1/2 x^T A x - x^T b + l^T B_D x$, where $l$
 * is a Lagrange multiplier for the constraints. The stationarity
 * condition then reads
 * \begin{verbatim}
 * [ A   B_D^T ] [x] = [b  ]
 * [ B_D 0     ] [l] = [g_D]
 * \begin{verbatim}
 *
 * The first equation then reads $B_D^T l = b-Ax$. On the other hand,
 * if we left-multiply the first equation by $B_D^T B_D$, we obtain
 * $B_D^T B_D A x + B_D^T l = B_D^T B_D b$ after equating $B_D B_D^T$
 * to the identity matrix. Inserting the previous equality, this
 * yields $(A - B_D^T B_D A) x = (1 - B_D^T B_D)b$. Since
 * $x=(1 - B_D^T B_D) x + B_D^T B_D x = (1 - B_D^T B_D) x + B_D^T g_D$,
 * we can restate the linear system:
 * $A_D x = (1 - B_D^T B_D)b - (1 - B_D^T B_D) A B^T g_D$, where
 * $A_D = (1 - B_D^T B_D) A (1 - B_D^T B_D)$ is the matrix where all
 * rows and columns corresponding to constrained nodes have been deleted.
 *
 * The last system of equation only defines the value of the
 * unconstrained nodes, while the constrained ones are determined by
 * the equation $B_D x = g_D$. We can combine these two linear systems
 * by using the zeroed out rows of $A_D$: if we set the diagonal to
 * $1$ and the corresponding zeroed out element of the right hand side
 * to that of $g_D$, then this fixes the constrained elements as
 * well. We can write this as follows:
 * $A_X x = (1 - B_D^T B_D)b - (1 - B_D^T B_D) A B^T g_D + B_D^T g_D$,
 * where $A_X = A_D + B_D^T B_D$. Note that the two parts of the
 * latter matrix operate on disjoint subspaces (the first on the
 * unconstrained nodes, the latter on the constrained ones).
 *
 * In iterative solvers, it is not actually necessary to compute $A_X$
 * explicitly, since only matrix-vector operations need to be
 * performed. This can be done in a three-step procedure that first
 * clears all elements in the incoming vector that belong to
 * constrained nodes, then performs the product with the matrix $A$,
 * then clears again. This class is a wrapper to this procedure, it
 * takes a pointer to a matrix with which to perform matrix-vector
 * products, and does the cleaning of constrained elements itself.
 * This class therefore implements an overloaded @p vmult function
 * that does the matrix-vector product, as well as @p Tvmult for
 * transpose matrix-vector multiplication and @p residual for
 * residual computation, and can thus be used as a matrix replacement
 * in lineaer solvers.
 *
 * It also has the ability to generate the modification of the right
 * hand side, through the apply_constraints() function.
 *
 *
 * @sect3{Connection to other classes}
 *
 * The function @p MatrixTools::apply_boundary_values does exactly
 * the same that this class does, except for the fact that that
 * function actually modifies the matrix. Due to this, it is only
 * possible to solve with a matrix onto which
 * @p MatrixTools::apply_boundary_values was applied for one right
 * hand side and one set of boundary values since the modification of
 * the right hand side depends on the original matrix.
 *
 * While this is fine (and the recommended way) in cases where only
 * one solution of the linear system is required, for example in
 * solving linear stationary systems, one would often like to have the
 * ability to solve multiply with the same matrix in nonlinear
 * problems (where one often does not want to update the Hessian
 * between Newton steps, despite having different right hand sides in
 * subsequent steps) or time dependent problems, without having to
 * re-assemble the matrix or copy it to temporary matrices with which
 * one then can work. For these cases, this class is meant.
 *
 *
 * @sect3{Usage}
 *
 * Usage is simple: create an object of this type, point it to a
 * matrix that shall be used for $A$ above (either through the
 * constructor, the copy constructor, or the
 * set_referenced_matrix() function), specify the list of boundary
 * values or other constraints (through the add_constraints()
 * function), and then for each required solution modify the right
 * hand side vector (through apply_constraints()) and use this
 * object as matrix object in a linear solver. As linear solvers
 * should only use vmult() and residual() functions of a
 * matrix class, this class should be as a good a matrix as any other
 * for that purpose.
 *
 * Furthermore, also the precondition_Jacobi() function is
 * provided (since the computation of diagonal elements of the
 * filtered matrix $A_X$ is simple), so you can use this as a
 * preconditioner. Some other function useful for matrices are also
 * available.
 *
 * A typical code snippet showing the above steps is as follows:
 * @verbatim
 *   ... // set up sparse matrix A and right hand side b somehow
 *
 *                     // initialize filtered matrix with
 *                     // matrix and boundary value constraints
 *   FilteredMatrix<SparseMatrix<double> > filtered_A (A);
 *   filtered_A.add_constraints (boundary_values);
 *
 *                     // set up a linear solver
 *   SolverControl control (1000, 1.e-10, false, false);
 *   PrimitiveVectorMemory<Vector<double> > mem;
 *   SolverCG<Vector<double> > solver (control, mem);
 *
 *                     // set up a preconditioner object
 *   PreconditionJacobi<FilteredMatrix<SparseMatrix<double> > > prec;
 *   prec.initialize (filtered_A, 1.2);
 *
 *                     // compute modification of right hand side
 *   filtered_A.apply_constraints (b, true);
 *
 *                     // solve for solution vector x
 *   solver.solve (filtered_A, x, b, prec);
 * @endverbatim
 *
 *
 * @sect3{Template arguments}
 *
 * This class takes as template arguments a matrix and a vector
 * class. The former must provide @p vmult, @p Tvmult, and
 * @p residual member function that operate on the vector type (the
 * second template argument). The latter template parameter must
 * provide access to indivual elements through <tt>operator()</tt>,
 * assignment through <tt>operator=</tt>.
 *
 *
 * @sect3{Thread-safety}
 *
 * The functions that operate as a matrix and do not change the
 * internal state of this object are synchronised and thus
 * threadsafe. You need not serialize calls to @p vmult or
 * @p residual therefore. Because these functions require the use of
 * a temporary, they block mutual execution, however. It is necessary
 * to allocate this temporary vector in class space since otherwise we
 * would have to allocate such a vector each time one of the member
 * functions is called (which may be very often for slowly converging
 * linear systems), which would be a serious performance
 * bottleneck. If you don't want this serialization of operations, you
 * have to use several objects of this type.
