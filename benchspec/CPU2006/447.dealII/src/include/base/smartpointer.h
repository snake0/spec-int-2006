/**
 * Smart pointers avoid destruction of an object in use. They can be used just
 * like a pointer (i.e. using the <tt>*</tt> and <tt>-></tt> operators and through casting)
 * but make sure that the object pointed to is not deleted in the course of
 * use of the pointer by signalling the pointee its use.
 *
 * Objects pointed to should inherit <tt>Subscriptor</tt> or must implement
 * the same functionality. Null pointers are an exception from this
 * rule and are allowed, too.
 *
 * SmartPointer does NOT implement any memory handling! Especially,
 * deleting a SmartPointer does not delete the object. Writing
 * @code
 * SmartPointer<T> t = new T;
 * @endcode
 * is a sure way to program a memory leak! The secure version is
 * @code
 * T* p = new T;
 * {
 *   SmartPointer<T> t = p;
 *   ...
 * }
 * delete p;
 * @endcode
 *
 * Note that a smart pointer can handle <tt>const</tt>ness of an object, i.e.
 * a <tt>SmartPointer<const ABC></tt> really behaves as if it were a pointer to
 * a constant object (disallowing write access when dereferenced), while
 * <tt>SmartPointer<ABC></tt> is a mutable pointer.
