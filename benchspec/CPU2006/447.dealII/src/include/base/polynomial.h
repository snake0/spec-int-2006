/**
 * Hierarchical polynomials of arbitrary degree on <tt>[0,1]</tt>.
 *
 * When Constructing a Hierarchical polynomial of degree <tt>p</tt>, 
 * the coefficients will be computed by a recursion formula.  The
 * coefficients are stored in a static data vector to be available
 * when needed next time.
 *
 * These hierarchical polynomials are based on those of Demkowicz, Oden, 
 * Rachowicz, and Hardy (CMAME 77 (1989) 79-112, Sec. 4). The first two
 * polynomials are the standard linear shape functions given by 
 * $\phi_{0}(x) = 1 - x$ and $\phi_{1}(x) = x$. For $l \geq 2$
 * we use the definitions $\phi_{l}(x) = (2x-1)^l - 1, l = 2,4,6,...$
 * and $\phi_{l}(x) = (2x-1)^l - (2x-1), l = 3,5,7,...$. These satisfy the 
 * recursion relations $\phi_{l}(x) = (2x-1)\phi_{l-1}, l=3,5,7,...$ and 
 * $\phi_{l}(x) = (2x-1)\phi_{l-1} + \phi_{2}, l=4,6,8,...$. 
 *
 * The degrees of freedom are the values at the vertices and the 
 * derivatives at the midpoint. Currently, we do not scale the
 * polynomials in any way, although better conditioning of the 
 * element stiffness matrix could possibly be achieved with scaling.
 *
 * Calling the constructor with a given index <tt>p</tt> will generate the
 * following: if <tt>p==0</tt>, then the resulting polynomial is the linear
 * function associated with the left vertex, if <tt>p==1</tt> the one
 * associated with the right vertex. For higher values of <tt>p</tt>, you
 * get the polynomial of degree <tt>p</tt> that is orthogonal to all
 * previous ones. Note that for <tt>p==0</tt> you therefore do <b>not</b>
 * get a polynomial of degree zero, but one of degree one. This is to
 * allow generating a complete basis for polynomial spaces, by just
 * iterating over the indices given to the constructor.
 *
 * On the other hand, the function generate_complete_basis() creates
 * a complete basis of given degree. In order to be consistent with
 * the concept of a polynomial degree, if the given argument is zero,
 * it does <b>not</b> return the linear polynomial described above, but
 * rather a constant polynomial.
