/**
 * A class that simplifies the process of execution logging. It does so by
 * providing
 * <ul>
 * <li> a push and pop mechanism for prefixes, and
 * <li> the possibility of distributing information to files and the
 *   console.
 * </ul>
 *
 * The usual usage of this class is through the pregenerated object
 * <tt>deallog</tt>. Typical steps are
 * <ul>
 * <li> <tt>deallog.attach(std::ostream)</tt>: write logging information into a file.
 * <li> <tt>deallog.depth_console(n)</tt>: restrict output on screen to outer loops.
 * <li> Before entering a new phase of your program, e.g. a new loop,
 *       <tt>deallog.push("loopname")</tt>.
 * <li> <tt>deallog << anything << std::endl;</tt> to write logging information
 *       (Usage of <tt>std::endl</tt> is mandatory!).
 * <li> <tt>deallog.pop()</tt> when leaving that stage entered with <tt>push</tt>.
 * </ul>
