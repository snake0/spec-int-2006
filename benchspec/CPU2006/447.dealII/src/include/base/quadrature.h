/**
 * Base class for quadrature formulae in arbitrary dimensions. This class
 * stores quadrature points and weights on the unit line [0,1], unit
 * square [0,1]x[0,1], etc.
 *
 * There are a number of derived classes, denoting concrete
 * integration formulae. Their names names prefixed by
 * <tt>Q</tt>. Refer to the list of derived classes for more details.
 *
 * The schemes for higher dimensions are tensor products of the
 * one-dimansional formulae. Therefore, a three-dimensional 5-point
 * Gauss formula has 125 quadrature points.
 *
 * @section QuadratureBlaBla Mathematical background
 *
 * For each quadrature formula we denote by <tt>m</tt>, the maximal
 * degree of polynomials integrated exactly. This number is given in
 * the documentation of each formula. The order of the integration
 * error is <tt>m+1</tt>, that is, the error is the size of the cell
 * two the <tt>m+1</tt> by the Bramble-Hilbert Lemma. The number
 * <tt>m</tt> is to be found in the documentation of each concrete
 * formula. For the optimal formulae QGauss we have $m = 2N-1$, where
 * N is the constructor parameter to QGauss. The tensor product
 * formulae are exact on tensor product polynomials of degree
 * <tt>m</tt> in each space direction, but they are still only of
 * <tt>m+1</tt>st order.
 *
 * @section QuadratureImpl Implementation details
 *
 * Most integration formulae in more than one space dimension are
 * tensor products of quadrature formulae in one space dimension, or
 * more generally the tensor product of a formula in <tt>(dim-1)</tt>
 * dimensions and one in one dimension. There is a special constructor
 * to generate a quadrature formula from two others.  For example, the
 * QGauss@<dim@> formulae include <i>N<sup>dim</sup></i> quadrature
 * points in <tt>dim</tt> dimensions, where N is the constructor
 * parameter of QGauss.
 *
 * For some programs it is necessary to have a quadrature object for
 * faces.  These programs fail to link if compiled for only one space
 * dimension, since there quadrature rules for faces just don't make
 * no sense. In order to allow these programs to be linked anyway, for
 * class Quadrature@<0@> all functions are provided in the
 * <tt>quadrature.cc</tt> file, but they will throw exceptions if actually
 * called. The only function which is allowed to be called is the
 * constructor taking one integer, which in this case ignores its
 * parameter, and of course the destructor. Besides this, it is
 * necessary to provide a class Point@<0@> to make the compiler
 * happy. This class also does nothing.

/**
 *  This class is a helper class to facilitate the usage of quadrature formulae
 *  on faces or subfaces of cells. It computes the locations of quadrature
 *  points on the unit cell from a quadrature object for a manifold of
 *  one dimension less than that of the cell and the number of the face.
 *  For example, giving the Simpson rule in one dimension and using the
 *  project_to_face() function with face number 1, the returned points will
 *  be (1,0), (1,0.5) and (1,1). Note that faces have an orientation,
 *  so when projecting to face 3, you will get (0,0), (0,0.5) and (0,1),
 *  which is in clockwise sense, while for face 1 the points were in
 *  counterclockwise sense.
 *
 *  For the projection to subfaces (i.e. to the children of a face of the
 *  unit cell), the same applies as above. Note the order in which the
 *  children of a face are numbered, which in two dimensions coincides
 *  with the orientation of the face.
 *
 *  The second set of functions generates a quadrature formula by
 *  projecting a given quadrature rule on <b>all</b> faces and
 *  subfaces. This is used in the FEFaceValues and
 *  FESubfaceValues classes. Since we now have the quadrature
 *  points of all faces and subfaces in one array, we need to have a
 *  way to find the starting index of the points and weights
 *  corresponding to one face or subface within this array. This is
 *  done through the DataSetDescriptor member class.
 *  
 *  The different functions are grouped into a common class to avoid
 *  putting them into global namespace. However, since they have no
 *  local data, all functions are declared <tt>static</tt> and can be
 *  called without creating an object of this class.
 *
 *  For the 3d case, you should note that the orientation of faces is
 *  even more intricate than for two dimensions. Quadrature formulae
 *  are projected upon the faces in their standard orientation, not to
 *  the inside or outside of the hexahedron. Refer to the
 *  documentation of the <tt>Triangulation</tt> class for a description of
 *  the orientation of the different faces. To make things more
 *  complicated, in 3d we allow faces in two orientations (which can
 *  be identified using <tt>cell->face_orientation(face)</tt>), so we have
 *  to project quadrature formula onto faces and subfaces in two
 *  orientations. The DataSetDescriptor member class is used to
 *  identify where each dataset starts.
