/**
 * Eulerian mapping of general unit cells by d-linear shape
 * functions. Each cell is thus shifted in space by values given to
 * the mapping through a finite element field.
 *
 * @sect3{Usage} 
 *
 * The constructor of this class takes two arguments: a reference to
 * the vector that defines the mapping from the reference
 * configuration to the current configuration and a reference to the
 * DoFHandler. The vector should then represent a (flattened out
 * version of a) vector valued field defined at nodes defined by the 
 * the DoFHandler, where the number of components of the vector
 * field equals the number of space dimensions. Thus, the 
 * DoFHandler shall operate on a finite element that has as many 
 * components as space dimensions. As an additional requirement, we 
 * impose that it have as many degree of freedom per vertex as there
 * are space dimensions; since this object only evaluates the finite 
 * element field at the vertices, the values
 * of all other degrees of freedom (not associated to vertices) are
 * ignored. These requirements are met if the finite element which the
 * given DoFHandler operates on is constructed as a system
 * element (FESystem) from @p dim continuous FE_Q()
 * objects.
 *
 * In many cases, the shift vector will also be the solution vector of
 * the problem under investigation. If this is not the case (i.e. the
 * number of components of the solution variable is not equal to the
 * space dimension, e.g. for scalar problems in <tt>dim>1</tt> where the
 * Eulerian coordinates only give a background field) or for coupled
 * problems where more variables are computed than just the flow
 * field), then a different DoFHandler has to be set up on the
 * given triangulation, and the shift vector has then to be associated
 * to it.
 *
 * An example is shown below:
 * @verbatim
 *    FESystem<dim> fe(FE_Q<dim>(1), dim);
 *    DoFHandler<dim> flowfield_dof_handler(triangulation);
 *    flowfield_dof_handler.distribute_dofs(fe);
 *    Vector<double> map_points(flowfield_dof_handler.n_dofs());
 *    MappingQ1Eulerian<dim> mymapping(map_points, flowfield_dof_handler);
 * @endverbatim
 *
 * Note that since the vector of shift values and the dof handler are
 * only associated to this object at construction time, you have to
 * make sure that whenever you use this object, the given objects
 * still represent valid data.
