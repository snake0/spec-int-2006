/**
 * Implementation of continuous Raviart-Thomas elements for the space
 * H_div. Note, however, that continuity only concerns the normal
 * component of the vector field.
 *
 * The constructor of this class takes the degree @p p of this finite
 * element. The numbering of the degree of this element in the
 * literature is somewhat funny: the degree is defined not as the
 * polynomial degree of the finite element space, but as that of the
 * normal component of the traces onto the boundary. Thus, the lowest
 * order, zero, has linear shape functions, but on the faces, the
 * traces of the normal component of these elements is constant on
 * each face.
 * 
 * 
 * @sect3{Interpolation to finer and coarser meshes}
 *
 * Each finite element class in deal.II provides matrices that are
 * used to interpolate from coarser to finer meshes and the other way
 * round. Interpolation from a mother cell to its children is usually
 * trivial, since finite element spaces are normally nested and this
 * kind of interpolation is therefore exact. On the other hand, when
 * we interpolate from child cells to the mother cell, we usually have
 * to throw away some information.
 *
 * For continuous elements, this transfer usually happens by
 * interpolating the values on the child cells at the support points
 * of the shape functions of the mother cell. However, for
 * discontinuous elements, we often use a projection from the child
 * cells to the mother cell. The projection approach is only possible
 * for discontinuous elements, since it cannot be guaranteed that the
 * values of the projected functions on one cell and its neighbor
 * match. In this case, only an interpolation can be
 * used. (Internally, whether the values of a shape function are
 * interpolated or projected, or better: whether the matrices the
 * finite element provides are to be treated with the properties of a
 * projection or of an interpolation, is controlled by the
 * @p restriction_is_additive flag. See there for more information.)
 *
 * Here, things are not so simple: since the element has some
 * continuity requirements across faces, we can only resort to some
 * kind of interpolation. On the other hand, for the lowest order
 * elements, the values of generating functionals are the (constant)
 * tangential values of the shape functions. We would therefore really
 * like to take the mean value of the tangential values of the child
 * faces, and make this the value of the mother face. Then, however,
 * taking a mean value of two piecewise constant function is not an
 * interpolation, but a restriction. Since this is not possible, we
 * cannot use this.
 *
 * To make a long story somewhat shorter, when interpolating from
 * refined edges to a coarse one, we do not take the mean value, but
 * pick only one (the one from the first child edge). While this is
 * not optimal, it is certainly a valid choice (using an interpolation
 * point that is not in the middle of the cell, but shifted to one
 * side), and it also preserves the order of the interpolation.
 * 
 *
 * @sect3{Numbering of the degrees of freedom (DoFs)}
 *
 * Nedelec elements have their degrees of freedom on edges, with shape
 * functions being vector valued and pointing in tangential
 * direction. We use the standard enumeration and direction of edges
 * in deal.II, yielding the following shape functions in 2d:
 *
 *   @verbatim
 *          2
 *      *---^---*
 *      |       |
 *     3>       >1
 *      |       |
 *      *---^---*
 *          0
 *   @endverbatim
 *
 * For the 3d case, the ordering follows the same scheme: the lines
 * are numbered as described in the documentation of the
 * Triangulation class, i.e.
 *   @verbatim
 *         *---6---*        *---6---*
 *        /|       |       /       /|
 *      11 |       5      11     10 5
 *      /  7       |     /       /  |
 *     *   |       |    *---2---*   |
 *     |   *---4---*    |       |   *
 *     |  /       /     |       1  /
 *     3 8       9      3       | 9
 *     |/       /       |       |/
 *     *---0---*        *---0---*
 *   @endverbatim
 * and their directions are as follows:
 *   @verbatim
 *         *--->---*        *--->---*
 *        /|       |       /       /|
 *       ^ |       ^      ^       ^ ^
 *      /  ^       |     /       /  |
 *     *   |       |    *--->---*   |
 *     |   *--->---*    |       |   *
 *     |  /       /     |       ^  /
 *     ^ ^       ^      ^       | ^
 *     |/       /       |       |/
 *     *--->---*        *--->---*
 *   @endverbatim
 *
 * The element does not make much sense in 1d, so it is not
 * implemented there.
