/**
 * Base class for finite elements in arbitrary dimensions. This class
 * provides several fields which describe a specific finite element
 * and which are filled by derived classes. It more or less only
 * offers the fields and access functions which makes it possible to
 * copy finite elements without knowledge of the actual type (linear,
 * quadratic, etc).
 *
 * The different matrices are initialized with the correct size, such
 * that in the derived (concrete) finite element classes, their
 * entries only have to be filled in; no resizing is needed. If the
 * matrices are not defined by a concrete finite element, they should
 * be resized to zero. This way functions using them can find out,
 * that they are missing. On the other hand, it is possible to use
 * finite element classes without implementation of the full
 * functionality, if only part of it is needed. The functionality
 * under consideration here is hanging nodes constraints and grid
 * transfer, respectively.
 *
 *
 * @sect3{Support points}
 *
 * Since a FiniteElement does not have information on the actual
 * grid cell, it can only provide support points on the unit
 * cell. Support points on the actual grid cell must be computed by
 * mapping these points. The class used for this kind of operation is
 * FEValues. In most cases, code of the following type will
 * serve to provide the mapped support points.
 *
 * @code
 * Quadrature<dim> dummy_quadrature (fe.get_unit_support_points());
 * FEValues<dim>   fe_values (mapping, fe, dummy_quadrature,
 *                            update_q_points);
 * fe_values.reinit (cell);
 * Point<dim>& mapped_point = fe_values.quadrature_point (i);
 * @endcode
 *
 * Alternatively, the points can be transformed one-by-one:
 * @code
 * const vector<Point<dim> >& unit_points =
 *    fe.get_unit_support_points();
 *
 * Point<dim> mapped_point =
 *    mapping.transform_unit_to_real_cell (cell, unit_points[i]);
 * @endcode
 * This is a shortcut, and as all shortcuts should be used cautiously.
 * If the mapping of all support points is needed, the first variant should
 * be preferred for efficiency.
 *
 * @sect3{Finite elements in one dimension}
 *
 * Finite elements in one dimension need only set the #restriction
 * and #prolongation matrices. The constructor of this class in one
 * dimension presets the #interface_constraints matrix to have
 * dimension zero. Changing this behaviour in derived classes is
 * generally not a reasonable idea and you risk getting into trouble.
 * 
 * @sect3{Finite elements in two dimensions}
 * 
 * In addition to the fields already present in 1D, a constraint
 * matrix is needed, if the finite element has node values located on
 * edges or vertices. These constraints are represented by an $m\times
 * n$-matrix #interface_constraints, where <i>n</i> is the number of
 * degrees of freedom on the refined side without the corner vertices
 * (those dofs on the middle vertex plus those on the two lines), and
 * <i>m</i> is that of the unrefined side (those dofs on the two
 * vertices plus those on the line). The matrix is thus a rectangular
 * one.
 *
 * The mapping of the dofs onto the indices of the matrix on the
 * unrefined side is as follows: let $d_v$ be the number of dofs on a
 * vertex, $d_l$ that on a line, then $m=0...d_v-1$ refers to the dofs
 * on vertex zero of the unrefined line, $m=d_v...2d_v-1$ to those on
 * vertex one, $m=2d_v...2d_v+d_l-1$ to those on the line.
 *
 * Similarly, $n=0...d_v-1$ refers to the dofs on the middle vertex of
 * the refined side (vertex one of child line zero, vertex zero of
 * child line one), $n=d_v...d_v+d_l-1$ refers to the dofs on child
 * line zero, $n=d_v+d_l...d_v+2d_l-1$ refers to the dofs on child
 * line one.  Please note that we do not need to reserve space for the
 * dofs on the end vertices of the refined lines, since these must be
 * mapped one-to-one to the appropriate dofs of the vertices of the
 * unrefined line.
 *
 * It should be noted that it is not possible to distribute a constrained
 * degree of freedom to other degrees of freedom which are themselves
 * constrained. Only one level of indirection is allowed. It is not known
 * at the time of this writing whether this is a constraint itself.
 *
 * @sect3{Finite elements in three dimensions}
 *
 * For the interface constraints, almost the same holds as for the 2D case.
 * The numbering for the indices $m$ on the mother face is obvious and keeps
 * to the usual numbering of degrees of freedom on quadrilaterals.
 *
 * The numbering of the degrees of freedom on the interior of the refined
 * faces for the index $n$ is as follows: let $d_v$ and $d_l$ be as above,
 * and $d_q$ be the number of degrees of freedom per quadrilateral (and
 * therefore per face), then $n=0...d_v-1$ denote the dofs on the vertex at
 * the center, $n=d_v...5d_v-1$ for the dofs on the vertices at the center
 * of the bounding lines of the quadrilateral,
 * $n=5d_v..5d_v+4*d_l-1$ are for the degrees of freedom on
 * the four lines connecting the center vertex to the outer boundary of the
 * mother face, $n=5d_v+4*d_l...5d_v+4*d_l+8*d_l-1$ for the degrees of freedom
 * on the small lines surrounding the quad,
 * and $n=5d_v+12*d_l...5d_v+12*d_l+4*d_q-1$ for the dofs on the
 * four child faces. Note the direction of the lines at the boundary of the
 * quads, as shown below.
 *
 * The order of the twelve lines and the four child faces can be extracted
 * from the following sketch, where the overall order of the different
 * dof groups is depicted:
 * @verbatim
 *    *--13--3--14--*
 *    |      |      |
 *    16 20  7  19  12
 *    |      |      |
 *    4--8---0--6---2
 *    |      |      |
 *    15 17  5  18  11
 *    |      |      |
 *    *--9---1--10--*
 * @endverbatim
 * The numbering of vertices and lines, as well as the numbering of
 * children within a line is consistent with the one described in
 * Triangulation. Therefore, this numbering is seen from the
 * outside and inside, respectively, depending on the face.
 *
 * If of the cells adjacent to one line more than one is refined and
 * there is at least one unrefined cell, then the degrees of freedom
 * on the refined line are constrained from two cells. For example,
 * consider the cell behind the face shown above is refined, while the
 * one in front of the face is not refined; then the dofs on the lines
 * numbered 9 and 10 are constrained. If there are two more cells
 * below the ones just introduced, with a common face right below the
 * one shown, and of these is one refined and one unrefined one, then
 * the degrees on the two mentioned small lines are constrained a
 * second time. Since these constraints must be unique, it follows
 * that the constraints for the degrees of freedom on refined lines
 * may only be in terms of the degrees of freedom on the unrefined
 * line, not in terms of the other degrees of freedom on a face.
 *
 * Since the handling of constraints on degrees of freedom is mostly done
 * by the ConstraintMatrix class, this class checks whether the constraints
 * introduced from the two sides are unique; it is able to handle the fact
 * that the constraints for some of the dofs are entered more than once.
