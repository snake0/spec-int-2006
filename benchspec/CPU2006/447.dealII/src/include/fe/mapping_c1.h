/**
 * Mapping class that uses C1 (continuously differentiable) cubic
 * mappings of the boundary. This class is built atop of
 * MappingQ by simply determining the interpolation points for a
 * cubic mapping of the boundary differently: MappingQ chooses
 * them such that they interpolate the boundary, while this class
 * chooses them such that the discretized boundary is globally
 * continuously differentiable.
 *  
 * To use this class, make sure that the
 * Boundary::@p get_normals_at_vertices function is implemented
 * for the users boundary object.
