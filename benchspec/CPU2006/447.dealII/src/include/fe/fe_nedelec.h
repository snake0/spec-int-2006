/**
 * Implementation of continuous Nedelec elements for the space
 * H_curl. Note, however, that continuity only concerns the tangential
 * component of the vector field.
 *
 * The constructor of this class takes the degree @p p of this finite
 * element. However, presently, only lowest order elements
 * (i.e. <tt>p==1</tt>) are implemented. For a general overview of this
 * element and its properties, see the report by Anna Schneebeli that
 * is linked from the general documentation page of the library.
 *
 *
 * @sect3{Restriction on transformations}
 *
 * In some sense, the implementation of this element is not complete,
 * but you will rarely notice. Here is the fact: since the element is
 * vector-valued already on the unit cell, the Jacobian matrix (or its
 * inverse) is needed already to generate the values of the shape
 * functions on the cells in real space. This is in contrast to most
 * other elements, where you only need the Jacobian for the
 * gradients. Thus, to generate the gradients of Nedelec shape
 * functions, one would need to have the derivatives of the inverse of
 * the Jacobian matrix.
 *
 * Basically, the Nedelec shape functions can be understood as the
 * gradients of scalar shape functions on the real cell. They are thus
 * the inverse Jacobian matrix times the gradients of scalar shape
 * functions on the unit cell. The gradient of Nedelec shape functions
 * is then, by the product rule, the sum of first the derivative (with
 * respect to true coordinates) of the inverse Jacobian times the
 * gradient (in unit coordinates) of the scalar shape function, plus
 * second the inverse Jacobian times the derivative (in true
 * coordinates) of the gradient (in unit coordinates) of the scalar
 * shape functions. Note that each of the derivatives in true
 * coordinates can be expressed as inverse Jacobian times gradient in
 * unit coordinates.
 *
 * The problem is the derivative of the inverse Jacobian. This rank-3
 * tensor can actually be computed (and we did so in very early
 * versions of the library), but is a large task and very time
 * consuming, so we dropped it. Since it is not available, we simply
 * drop this first term.
 *
 * What this means for the present case: first the computation of
 * gradients of Nedelec shape functions is wrong. Second, you will not
 * notice this usually, for two reasons:
 *
 * The first reason is that the gradient of the Jacobian vanishes if
 * the cells are mapped by an affine mapping, to which the usual
 * bilinear mapping reduces if the cell is a parallelogram. Then the
 * gradient of the shape functions is computed exact, since the first
 * term is zero.
 *
 * Second, with the Nedelec elements, you will usually want to compute
 * the curl, and extract and sum up the respective elements of the
 * full gradient tensor. However, the curl of the Jacobian vanishes,
 * so for the curl of shape functions the first term is irrelevant,
 * and the curl will be computed correctly as well.
 * 
 * 
 * @sect3{Interpolation to finer and coarser meshes}
 *
 * Each finite element class in deal.II provides matrices that are
 * used to interpolate from coarser to finer meshes and the other way
 * round. Interpolation from a mother cell to its children is usually
 * trivial, since finite element spaces are normally nested and this
 * kind of interpolation is therefore exact. On the other hand, when
 * we interpolate from child cells to the mother cell, we usually have
 * to throw away some information.
 *
 * For continuous elements, this transfer usually happens by
 * interpolating the values on the child cells at the support points
 * of the shape functions of the mother cell. However, for
 * discontinuous elements, we often use a projection from the child
 * cells to the mother cell. The projection approach is only possible
 * for discontinuous elements, since it cannot be guaranteed that the
 * values of the projected functions on one cell and its neighbor
 * match. In this case, only an interpolation can be
 * used. (Internally, whether the values of a shape function are
 * interpolated or projected, or better: whether the matrices the
 * finite element provides are to be treated with the properties of a
 * projection or of an interpolation, is controlled by the
 * @p restriction_is_additive flag. See there for more information.)
 *
 * Here, things are not so simple: since the element has some
 * continuity requirements across faces, we can only resort to some
 * kind of interpolation. On the other hand, for the lowest order
 * elements, the values of generating functionals are the (constant)
 * tangential values of the shape functions. We would therefore really
 * like to take the mean value of the tangential values of the child
 * faces, and make this the value of the mother face. Then, however,
 * taking a mean value of two piecewise constant function is not an
 * interpolation, but a restriction. Since this is not possible, we
 * cannot use this.
 *
 * To make a long story somewhat shorter, when interpolating from
 * refined edges to a coarse one, we do not take the mean value, but
 * pick only one (the one from the first child edge). While this is
 * not optimal, it is certainly a valid choice (using an interpolation
 * point that is not in the middle of the cell, but shifted to one
 * side), and it also preserves the order of the interpolation.
 * 
 *
 * @sect3{Numbering of the degrees of freedom (DoFs)}
 *
 * Nedelec elements have their degrees of freedom on edges, with shape
 * functions being vector valued and pointing in tangential
 * direction. We use the standard enumeration and direction of edges
 * in deal.II, yielding the following shape functions in 2d:
 *
 *   @verbatim
 *          2
 *      *--->---*
 *      |       |
 *     3^       ^1
 *      |       |
 *      *--->---*
 *          0
 *   @endverbatim
 *
 * For the 3d case, the ordering follows the same scheme: the lines
 * are numbered as described in the documentation of the
 * Triangulation class, i.e.
 *   @verbatim
 *         *---6---*        *---6---*
 *        /|       |       /       /|
 *      11 |       5      11     10 5
 *      /  7       |     /       /  |
 *     *   |       |    *---2---*   |
 *     |   *---4---*    |       |   *
 *     |  /       /     |       1  /
 *     3 8       9      3       | 9
 *     |/       /       |       |/
 *     *---0---*        *---0---*
 *   @endverbatim
 * and their directions are as follows:
 *   @verbatim
 *         *--->---*        *--->---*
 *        /|       |       /       /|
 *       ^ |       ^      ^       ^ ^
 *      /  ^       |     /       /  |
 *     *   |       |    *--->---*   |
 *     |   *--->---*    |       |   *
 *     |  /       /     |       ^  /
 *     ^ ^       ^      ^       | ^
 *     |/       /       |       |/
 *     *--->---*        *--->---*
 *   @endverbatim
 *
 * The element does not make much sense in 1d, so it is not
 * implemented there.
