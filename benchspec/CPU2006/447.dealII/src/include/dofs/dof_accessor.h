/**
 * Define the basis for accessors to the degrees of freedom.
 *
 * Note that it is allowed to construct an object of which the
 * @p dof_handler pointer is a Null pointer. Such an object would
 * result in a strange kind of behaviour, though every reasonable
 * operating system should disallow access through that pointer.
 * The reason we do not check for the null pointer in the
 * constructor which gets passed the DoFHandler pointer is that
 * if we did we could not make dof iterators member of other classes
 * (like in the FEValues class) if we did not know about the
 * DoFHandler object to be used upon construction of that object.
 * Through the way this class is implemented here, we allow the
 * creation of a kind of virgin object which only gets useful if
 * assigned to from another object before first usage.
 *
 * Opposite to construction, it is not possible to copy an object
 * which has an invalid dof handler pointer. This is to guarantee
 * that every iterator which is once assigned to is a valid
 * object. However, this assertion only holds in debug mode, when
 * the @p Assert macro is switched on.

 * The DoFDimensionInfo classes inherited by the DoFHandler classes
 * declare typedefs to iterators using the accessors declared in this class

				      * This, again, is the
				      * counterpart to
				      * @p get_interpolated_dof_values:
				      * you specify the dof values on
				      * a cell and these are
				      * interpolated to the children
				      * of the present cell and set on
				      * the terminal cells.
				      *
				      * In principle, it works as
				      * follows: if the cell pointed
				      * to by this object is terminal,
				      * then the dof values are set in
				      * the global data vector by
				      * calling the @p set_dof_values
				      * function; otherwise, the
				      * values are prolonged to each
				      * of the children and this
				      * function is called for each of
				      * them.
				      *
				      * Using the
				      * @p get_interpolated_dof_values
				      * and this function, you can
				      * compute the interpolation of a
				      * finite element function to a
				      * coarser grid by first getting
				      * the interpolated solution on a
				      * cell of the coarse grid and
				      * afterwards redistributing it
				      * using this function.
				      *
				      * Note that for continuous
				      * finite elements, calling this
				      * function affects the dof
				      * values on neighboring cells as
				      * well. It may also violate
				      * continuity requirements for
				      * hanging nodes, if neighboring
				      * cells are less refined than
				      * the present one, or if their
				      * children are less refined than
				      * the children of this
				      * cell. These requirements are
				      * not taken care of and must be
				      * enforced by the user
				      * afterwards.
				      *
				      * It is assumed that both
				      * vectors already have the right
				      * size beforehand. This function
				      * relies on the existence of a
				      * natural interpolation property
				      * of finite element spaces of a
				      * cell to its children, denoted
				      * by the prolongation matrices
				      * of finite element classes. For
				      * some elements, the spaces on
				      * coarse and fine grids are not
				      * nested, in which case the
				      * interpolation to a child is
				      * not the identity; refer to the
				      * documentation of the
				      * respective finite element
				      * class for a description of
				      * what the prolongation matrices
				      * represent in this case.
				      *
				      * Unlike the @p set_dof_values
				      * function, this function is
				      * associated to cells rather
				      * than to lines, quads, and
				      * hexes, since interpolation is
				      * presently only provided for
				      * cells by the finite element
				      * objects.
				      *
				      * The output vector may be either a
				      * Vector<float>,
				      * Vector<double>, or a
				      * BlockVector<double>, or a
				      * PETSc vector if deal.II is compiled to
				      * support PETSc. It is in the
				      * responsibility of the caller to assure
				      * that the types of the numbers stored
				      * in input and output vectors are
				      * compatible and with similar accuracy.
