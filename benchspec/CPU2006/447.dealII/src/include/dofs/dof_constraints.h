/**
 * This class implements linear homogeneous constraints on degrees of
 * freedom. In particular, it handles constraints of the form
 * $x_{i_1} = \sum_{j=2}^M a_{i_j} x_{i_j}$. Each "line" in objects of this
 * class corresponds to one such constraint, with the number of the
 * line being $i1$, and the entries in this line being pairs
 * $(i_j,a_{i_j})$. Note that the constraints are linear in the $x_i$,
 * and that there is not constant (non-homogeneous) term in the
 * constraint. However, this is exactly the form we need for hanging
 * node and certain other constraints, where we need to constrain one
 * degree of freedom in terms of others. The name of the class stems
 * from the fact that these constraints can be represented in matrix
 * form as $X x = 0$, and this object then describes the matrix $X$.
 *
 * The matrix is organized in lines (rows), but only those lines are stored
 * where constraints are present. New constraints are added by adding new
 * lines using the add_line() function, and then populating it using the
 * add_entry() function to a given line, or add_entries() to add more
 * than one entry at a time. After all constraints have been added, you need
 * to call close(), which compresses the storage format and sorts the
 * entries.
 *
 * Constraint matrices are used to handle hanging nodes and other constrained
 * degrees of freedom. When building the global system matrix and the right
 * hand sides, you normally build them without taking care of the constraints,
 * purely on a topological base, i.e. by a loop over cells. In order to do
 * actual calculations, you have to 'condense' the linear system: eliminate
 * constrained degrees of freedom and distribute the appropriate values to the
 * unconstrained dofs. This changes the sparsity pattern of the sparse
 * matrices used in finite element calculations und is thus a quite expensive
 * operation. The general scheme of things is that you build your system, you
 * eliminate (condense) away constrained nodes using the condense() functions
 * of this class, then you solve the remaining system, and finally you compute
 * the values of constrained nodes from the values of the unconstrained ones
 * using the distribute() function. Note that the condense() function is
 * applied to matrix and right hand side of the linear system, while the
 * distribute() function is applied to the solution vector. Note also that the
 * distribute_local_to_global() functions discussed below are equivalent to
 * condense() functions, and are thus to be applied to matrices and right hand
 * side vectors, and are not to be confused with the distribute() function
 * which has to applied to the solution vector.
 *
 *
 * @sect3{Condensing matrices and sparsity patterns}
 * 
 * Condensation of a matrix is done in four steps: first one builds the
 * sparsity pattern (e.g. using
 * DoFHandler@p ::create_sparsity_pattern); then the sparsity pattern
 * of the condensed matrix is made out of the original sparsity pattern and
 * the constraints; third, the global matrix is assembled; and fourth, the
 * matrix is finally condensed. To do these steps, you have (at least) two
 * possibilities:
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li> Use two different sparsity patterns and two different matrices: you
 *   may eliminate the lines and rows connected with a constraint and create
 *   a totally new sparsity pattern and a new system matrix. This has the
 *   advantage that the resulting system of equations is smaller and free from
 *   artifacts of the condensation process and is therefore faster in the solution
 *   process since no unnecessary multiplications occur (see below). However, there are
 *   two major drawbacks: keeping two matrices at the same time can be quite
 *   unacceptable if you're short of memory. Secondly, the condensation process is 
 *   expensive, since <em>all</em> entries of the matrix have to be copied, not only
 *   those which are subject to constraints.
 *
 * <li> Use only one sparsity pattern and one matrix: doing it this way, the
 *   condense functions add nonzero entries to the sparsity pattern of the large
 *   matrix (with constrained nodes in it) where the condensation process of the
 *   matrix will create additional nonzero elements. In the condensation process
 *   itself, lines and rows subject to constraints are distributed to the lines
 *   and rows of unconstrained nodes. The constrained lines remain in place,
 *   however, unlike in the first possibility described above. In order not to
 *   disturb the solution process, these lines and rows are filled with zeros
 *   and an appropriate positive value on the main diagonal (we choose an
 *   average of the magnitudes of the other diagonal elements, so as to make
 *   sure that the new diagonal entry has the same order of magnitude as the
 *   other entries; this preserves the scaling properties of the matrix). The
 *   appropriate value in the right hand sides is set to zero. This way, the
 *   constrained node will always get the value zero upon solution of the
 *   equation system and will not couple to other nodes any more.
 *
 *   This method has the advantage that only one matrix and sparsity pattern is
 *   needed thus using less memory. Additionally, the condensation process is
 *   less expensive, since not all but only constrained values in the matrix
 *   have to be copied. On the other hand, the solution process will take a bit
 *   longer, since matrix vector multiplications will incur multiplications
 *   with zeroes in the lines subject to constraints. Additionally, the vector
 *   size is larger than in the first possibility, resulting in more memory
 *   consumption for those iterative solution methods using a larger number of
 *   auxiliary vectors (e.g. methods using explicit orthogonalization
 *   procedures).
 * </ul>
 *
 * Usually, the second way is chosen since memory consumption upon
 * construction of a second matrix rules out the first
 * possibility. Furthermore, all example programs use this method, and we
 * recommend that you use it instead of the first way.
 *
 * This class provides two sets of @p condense functions: those taking two
 * arguments refer to the first possibility above, those taking only one do
 * their job in-place and refer to the second possibility.
 *
 * The condensation functions exist for different argument types. The in-place
 * functions (i.e. those following the second way) exist for arguments of type
 * SparsityPattern, SparseMatrix and BlockSparseMatrix. Note
 * that there are no versions for arguments of type
 * PETScWrappers::SparseMatrix() or any of the other PETSc matrix wrapper
 * classes. This is due to the fact that it is relatively hard to get a
 * representation of the sparsity structure of PETSc matrices, and to modify
 * them; this holds in particular, if the matrix is actually distributed
 * across a cluster of computers. If you want to use PETSc matrices, you can
 * either copy an already condensed deal.II matrix, or build the PETSc matrix
 * in the already condensed form.
 * 
 * 
 * @sect3{Condensing vectors}
 * 
 * Condensing vectors works exactly as described above for matrices. Note that
 * condensation is an idempotent operation, i.e. doing it more than once on a
 * vector or matrix yields the same result as doing it only once: once an
 * object has been condensed, further condensation operations don't change it
 * any more.
 *
 * In contrast to the matrix condensation functions, the vector condensation
 * functions exist in variants for PETSc vectors. However, using them is
 * typically expensive, and should be avoided. You should use the same
 * techniques as mentioned above to avoid their use.
 *
 * 
 * @sect3{Avoiding explicit condensation}
 *
 * Sometimes, one wants to avoid condensation at all. This may be the case
 * since condensation is an expensive operation, or because no condense()
 * function is defined for the matrix you use (this is, for example, the case
 * for the PETSc wrapper classes, where we have no access to the underlying
 * representation of the matrix, and therefore cannot efficiently implement
 * the condense() operation). In this case, one possibility is to distribute
 * local entries to the final destinations right at the moment of transferring
 * them into the global matrices and vectors. For this, one can use the
 * distribute_local_to_global() functions of this class, which make a
 * subsequent call to condense() unnecessary.
 *
 * Note that, despite their name which describes what the function really
 * does, the distribute_local_to_global() functions has to be applied to
 * matrices and right hand side vectors, whereas the distribute() function
 * discussed below is applied to the solution vector after solving the linear
 * system.
 * 
 * 
 * @sect3{Distributing constraints}
 * 
 * After solving the condensed system of equations, the solution vector has to
 * be redistributed. This is done by the two @p distribute function, one
 * working with two vectors, one working in-place. The operation of
 * distribution undoes the condensation process in some sense, but it should
 * be noted that it is not the inverse operation. Basically, distribution sets
 * the values of the constrained nodes to the value that is computed from the
 * constraint given the values of the unconstrained nodes. This is usually
 * necessary since the condensed linear systems only describe the equations
 * for unconstrained nodes, and constrained nodes need to get their values in
 * a second step.
