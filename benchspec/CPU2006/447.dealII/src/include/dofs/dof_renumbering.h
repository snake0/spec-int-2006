/**
 * Implementation of a number of renumbering algorithms for the degrees of
 * freedom on a triangulation.
 *
 * @sect2{Cuthill-McKee like algorithms}
 *
 * Within this class, the Cuthill-McKee algorithm is implemented. It starts
 * at a degree of freedom, searches the other DoFs for those which are couple
 * with the one we started with and numbers these in a certain way. It then
 * finds the second level of DoFs, namely those that couple with those of
 * the previous level (which were those that coupled with the initial DoF)
 * and numbers these. And so on. For the details of the algorithm, especially
 * the numbering within each level, we refer the reader to the book of
 * Schwarz (H.R.Schwarz: Methode der finiten Elemente). The reverse Cuthill-McKee
 * algorithm does the same job, but numbers all elements in the reverse order.
 *
 * These algorithms
 * have one major drawback: they require a good starting point, i.e. the degree
 * of freedom index afterwards to be numbered zero. This can thus be given by
 * the user, e.g. by exploiting knowledge of the actual topology of the
 * domain. It is also possible to give several starting indices, which may
 * be used to simulate a simple upstream numbering (by giving the inflow
 * dofs as starting values) or to make preconditioning faster (by letting
 * the dirichlet boundary indices be starting points).
 *
 * If no starting index is given, one is chosen by the program, namely one
 * with the smallest coordination number (the coordination number is the
 * number of other dofs this dof couples with). This dof is usually located
 * on the boundary of the domain. There is, however, large ambiguity in this
 * when using the hierarchical meshes used in this library, since in most
 * cases the computational domain is not approximated by tilting and deforming
 * elements and by plugging together variable numbers of elements at vertices,
 * but rather by hierarchical refinement. There is therefore a large number
 * of dofs with equal coordination numbers. The renumbering algorithms will
 * therefore not give optimal results.
 *
 * In the book of Schwarz (H.R.Schwarz: Methode der finiten Elemente), it is
 * advised to test many starting points, if possible all with the smallest
 * coordination number and also those with slightly higher numbers. However,
 * this seems only possible for meshes with at most several dozen or a few
 * hundred elements found in small engineering problems of the early 1980s
 * (the second edition was published in 1984), but certainly not with those
 * used in this library, featuring several 10,000 to a few 100,000 elements.
 *
 * On the other hand, the need to reduce the bandwidth has decreased since
 * with the mentioned number of cells, only iterative solution methods are
 * able to solve the resulting matrix systems. These, however, are not so
 * demanding with respect to the bandwidth as direct solvers used for
 * smaller problems. Things like upstream numbering become much more important
 * in recent times, so the suboptimality of the renumbering algorithms is
 * not that important any more.
 *
 * 
 * @sect3{Implementation of renumbering schemes}
 *
 * The renumbering algorithms need quite a lot of memory, since they have
 * to store for each dof with which other dofs it couples. This is done
 * using a SparsityPattern object used to store the sparsity pattern of
 * matrices. It
 * is not useful for the user to do anything between distributing the dofs
 * and renumbering, i.e. the calls to DoFHandler@p ::distribute_dofs and
 * DoFHandler@p ::renumber_dofs should follow each other immediately. If
 * you try to create a sparsity pattern or anything else in between, these
 * will be invalid afterwards.
 *
 * The renumbering may take care of dof-to-dof couplings only induced by
 * eliminating constraints. In addition to the memory consumption mentioned
 * above, this also takes quite some computational time, but it may be
 * switched off upon calling the @p renumber_dofs function. This will then
 * give inferior results, since knots in the graph (representing dofs)
 * are not found to be neighbors even if they would be after condensation.
 * 
 * The renumbering algorithms work on a purely algebraic basis, due to the
 * isomorphism between the graph theoretical groundwork underlying the
 * algorithms and binary matrices (matrices of which the entries are binary
 * values) represented by the sparsity patterns. In special, the algorithms
 * do not try to exploit topological knowledge (e.g. corner detection) to
 * find appropriate starting points. This way, however, they work in
 * arbitrary space dimension.
 *
 * If you want to give starting points, you may give a list of dof indices
 * which will form the first step of the renumbering. The dofs of the list
 * will be consecutively numbered starting with zero, i.e. this list is not
 * renumbered according to the coordination number of the nodes. Indices not
 * in the allowed range are deleted. If no index is allowed, the algorithm
 * will search for its own starting point.
 *
 * 
 * @sect3{Results of renumbering}
 *
 * The renumbering schemes mentioned above do not lead to optimal results.
 * However, after all there is no algorithm that accomplishes this within
 * reasonable time. There are situations where the lack of optimality even
 * leads to worse results than with the original, crude, levelwise numering
 * scheme; one of these examples is a mesh of four cells of which always
 * those cells are refined which are neighbors to the center (you may call
 * this mesh a `zoom in' mesh). In one such example the bandwidth was
 * increased by about 50 per cent.
 *
 * In most other cases, the bandwith is reduced significantly. The reduction
 * is the better the less structured the grid is. With one grid where the
 * cells were refined according to a random driven algorithm, the bandwidth
 * was reduced by a factor of six.
 *
 * Using the constraint information usually leads to reductions in bandwidth
 * of 10 or 20 per cent, but may for some very unstructured grids also lead
 * to an increase. You have to weigh the decrease in your case with the time
 * spent to use the constraint information, which usually is several times
 * longer than the `pure' renumbering algorithm.
 *
 * In almost all cases, the renumbering scheme finds a corner to start with.
 * Since there is more than one corner in most grids and since even an
 * interior degree of freedom may be a better starting point, giving the
 * starting point by the user may be a viable way if you have a simple
 * scheme to derive a suitable point (e.g. by successively taking the
 * third child of the cell top left of the coarsest level, taking its
 * third vertex and the dof index thereof, if you want the top left corner
 * vertex). If you do not know beforehand what your grid will look like
 * (e.g. when using adaptive algorithms), searching a best starting point
 * may be difficult, however, and in many cases will not justify the effort.
 *
 *
 * @sect2{Component-wise numbering}
 *
 * For finite elements composed of several base elements using the FESystem
 * class, or for elements which provide several components themselves, it
 * may be of interest to sort the DoF indices by component. This will then
 * bring out the block matrix structure, since otherwise the degrees of freedom
 * are numbered cell-wise without taking into account that they may belong to
 * different components.
 *
 * This kind of numbering may be obtained by calling the
 * @p component_wise function of this class. Since it does not touch
 * the order of indices within each, it may be worthwhile to first
 * renumber using the Cuthill-McKee or a similar algorithm and
 * afterwards renumbering component-wise. This will bring out the
 * matrix structure and additionally have a good numbering within each
 * block.
 *
 *
 * @sect2{Cell-wise numbering for Discontinuous Galerkin FEM}
 *
 * One advantage of DGFEM is the fact, that it yields invertible
 * blocks on the diagonal of the global matrix. these blocks are in
 * fact the cell matrices and matrix elements outside these blocks are
 * due to fluxes.
 *
 * Still, it may be necessary to apply a downstream numbering of the
 * degrees of freedom. This renumbering may only exchange whole blocks
 * and must not destroy the block structure.
 *
 * Given an ordered vector of cells, the function cell_wise_dg()
 * accomplishes this. Inside the cells, the previous ordering will be
 * preserved, so it may be useful to apply component_wise() first.
 *
 *
 * @sect2{Random renumbering}
 *
 * The @p random function renumbers degrees of freedom randomly. This
 * function is probably seldom of use, except to check the dependence of
 * solvers (iterative or direct ones) on the numbering of the degrees
 * of freedom. It uses the @p random_shuffle function from the C++
 * standard library to do its work.
 *
 *
 * @sect2{Other renumberings}
 *
 * Apart from the ones discussed above, there are a number of other
 * renumbering schemes implemented in this class. Refer to the detailed
 * function listings for each of the functions of this class.
 * 
 *
 * @sect2{Multigrid DoF numbering}
 *
 * Most algorithms also work on multigrid degree of freedom numberings. Refer
 * to the actual function declarations to get more information on this.
