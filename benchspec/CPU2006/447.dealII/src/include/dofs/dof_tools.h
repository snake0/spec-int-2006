/**
 * This is a collection of functions operating on, and manipulating
 * the numbers of degrees of freedom. The documentation of the member
 * functions will provide more information, but for functions that
 * exist in multiple versions, there are sections in this global
 * documentation stating some commonalities.
 *
 * All member functions are static, so there is no need to create an
 * object of class DoFTools.
 *
 *
 * @sect3{Setting up sparsity patterns}
 *
 * When assembling system matrices, the entries are usually of the form
 * $a_{ij} = a(\phi_i, \phi_j)$, where $a$ is a bilinear functional, often an
 * integral. When using sparse matrices, we therefore only need to reserve space
 * for those $a_{ij}$ only, which are nonzero, which is the same as to say that
 * the basis functions $\phi_i$ and $\phi_j$ have a nonempty intersection of
 * their support. Since the support of basis functions is bound only on cells
 * on which they are located or to which they are adjacent, to
 * determine the sparsity pattern it is sufficient to loop over all
 * cells and connect all basis functions on each cell with all other
 * basis functions on that cell.  There may be finite elements for
 * which not all basis functions on a cell connect with each other,
 * but no use of this case is made since no examples where this occurs
 * are known to the author.
 *
 * When setting up sparsity patterns for matrices on the boundary, the same
 * procedure is done, except for the fact that the loop only goes over faces
 * on the boundary and the basis functions thereon. It is assumed that all
 * other basis functions on a cell adjacent to the boundary vanish at the
 * boundary itself, except for those which are located on the boundary.
 *
 *
 *
 * @sect3{DoF numberings on boundaries}
 *
 * When projecting the traces of functions to the boundary or parts
 * thereof, one needs to build matrices and vectors with the degrees
 * of freedom on the boundary. What is needed in this case is a
 * numbering of the boundary degrees of freedom, starting from zero on
 * and not considering the degrees of freedom in the interior. The
 * @p map_dof_to_boundary_indices function does exactly this, by
 * providing a vector with as many entries as there are degrees of
 * freedom on the whole domain, with each entry being the number in
 * the numbering of the boundary or
 * DoFHandler@p ::invalid_dof_index if the dof is not on the
 * boundary. You should always use this function to get the mapping
 * between local (boundary) and the global numbers, for example to
 * build the mass matrix on the boundary, or to get the global index
 * of a degree of freedom if we want to use the solution of the
 * projection onto the boundary to eliminate the boundary degrees of
 * freedom from the global matrix.
 *
 * The algorithm to provide this numbering mapping is simple, but you
 * should not rely on it since it may be changed sometimes: we loop
 * over all faces, check whether it is on the boundary, if so get the
 * global numbers of the degrees of freedom on that face, and for each
 * of these we give a sequential boundary number if none has already
 * been given to this dof. But it should be emphasized again that you
 * should not try to use this internal knowledge about the used
 * algorithm, you are better off if you just accept the mapping `as
 * is'.
 *
 * Actually, there are two @p map_dof_to_boundary_indices functions,
 * one producing a numbering for all boundary degrees of freedom and
 * one producing a numbering for only parts of the boundary, namely
 * those parts for which the boundary indicator is listed in a set of
 * indicators given to the function. The latter case is needed if, for
 * example, we would only want to project the boundary values for the
 * Dirichlet part of the boundary, not for the other boundary
 * conditions. You then give the function a list of boundary
 * indicators referring to Dirichlet parts on which the projection is
 * to be performed. The parts of the boundary on which you want to
 * project need not be contiguous; however, it is not guaranteed that
 * the indices of each of the boundary parts are continuous, i.e. the
 * indices of degrees of freedom on different parts may be intermixed.
 *
 * Degrees of freedom on the boundary but not on one of the specified
 * boundary parts are given the index @p invalid_dof_index, as if
 * they were in the interior. If no boundary indicator was given or if
 * no face of a cell has a boundary indicator contained in the given
 * list, the vector of new indices consists solely of
 * @p invalid_dof_indexs.
 *
 * The question what a degree of freedom on the boundary is, is not so
 * easy.  It should really be a degree of freedom of which the
 * respective basis function has nonzero values on the boundary. At
 * least for Lagrange elements this definition is equal to the
 * statement that the off-point of the shape function, i.e. the point
 * where the function assumes its nominal value (for Lagrange elements
 * this is the point where it has the function value @p 1), is
 * located on the boundary. We do not check this directly, the
 * criterion is rather defined through the information the finite
 * element class gives: the FiniteElementBase class defines the
 * numbers of basis functions per vertex, per line, and so on and the
 * basis functions are numbered after this information; a basis
 * function is to be considered to be on the face of a cell (and thus
 * on the boundary if the cell is at the boundary) according to its
 * belonging to a vertex, line, etc but not to the cell. The finite
 * element uses the same cell-wise numbering so that we can say that
 * if a degree of freedom was numbered as one of the dofs on lines, we
 * assume that it is located on the line. Where the off-point actually
 * is, is a secret of the finite element (well, you can ask it, but we
 * don't do it here) and not relevant in this context.

				      * @p make_sparsity_pattern just
				      * loops over all cells and
				      * enters all couplings local to

				      * Since this process is purely

				      * an alternative to using
				      * stronger regularization of the
				      * problem.
				      *
				      * The basic idea of this
				      * function is explained in the
				      * following. Let us, for
				      * convenience, denote by
				      * ``parameter grid'' the coarser
				      * of the two grids, and by
				      * ``state grid'' the finer of
				      * the two. We furthermore assume
				      * that the finer grid can be
				      * obtained by refinement of the
				      * coarser one, i.e. the fine
				      * grid is at least as much
				      * refined as the coarse grid at
				      * each point of the
				      * domain. Then, each shape
				      * function on the coarse grid
				      * can be represented as a linear
				      * combination of shape functions
				      * on the fine grid (assuming
				      * identical ansatz
				      * spaces). Thus, if we
				      * discretize as usual, using
				      * shape functions on the fine
				      * grid, we can consider the
				      * restriction that the parameter
				      * variable shall in fact be
				      * discretized by shape functions
				      * on the coarse grid as a
				      * constraint. These constraints
				      * are linear and happen to have
				      * the form managed by the
				      * ``ConstraintMatrix'' class.
				      *
				      * The construction of these
				      * constraints is done as
				      * follows: for each of the
				      * degrees of freedom (i.e. shape
				      * functions) on the coarse grid,
				      * we compute its representation
				      * on the fine grid, i.e. how the
				      * linear combination of shape
				      * functions on the fine grid
				      * looks like that resembles the
				      * shape function on the coarse
				      * grid. From this information,
				      * we can then compute the
				      * constraints which have to hold
				      * if a solution of a linear
				      * equation on the fine grid
				      * shall be representable on the
				      * coarse grid. The exact
				      * algorithm how these
				      * constraints can be computed is
				      * rather complicated and is best
				      * understood by reading the
				      * source code, which contains
				      * many comments.
				      *
				      * Before explaining the use of
				      * this function, we would like
				      * to state that the total number
				      * of degrees of freedom used for
				      * the discretization is not
				      * reduced by the use of this
				      * function, i.e. even though we
				      * discretize one variable on a
				      * coarser grid, the total number
				      * of degrees of freedom is that
				      * of the fine grid. This seems
				      * to be counter-productive,
				      * since it does not give us a
				      * benefit from using a coarser
				      * grid. The reason why it may be
				      * useful to choose this approach
				      * nonetheless is three-fold:
				      * first, as stated above, there
				      * might not be enough
				      * information to recover a
				      * parameter on a fine grid,
				      * i.e. we chose to discretize it
				      * on the coarse grid not to save
				      * DoFs, but for other
				      * reasons. Second, the
				      * ``ConstraintMatrix'' includes
				      * the constraints into the
				      * linear system of equations, by
				      * which constrained nodes become
				      * dummy nodes; we may therefore
				      * exclude them from the linear
				      * algebra, for example by
				      * sorting them to the back of
				      * the DoF numbers and simply
				      * calling the solver for the
				      * upper left block of the matrix
				      * which works on the
				      * non-constrained nodes only,
				      * thus actually realizing the
				      * savings in numerical effort
				      * from the reduced number of
				      * actual degrees of freedom. The
				      * third reason is that for some
				      * or other reason we have chosen
				      * to use two different grids, it
				      * may be actually quite
				      * difficult to write a function
				      * that assembles the system
				      * matrix for finite element
				      * spaces on different grids;
				      * using the approach of
				      * constraints as with this
				      * function allows to use
				      * standard techniques when
				      * discretizing on only one grid
				      * (the finer one) without having
				      * to take care of the fact that
				      * one or several of the variable
				      * actually belong to different
				      * grids.
				      *
				      * The use of this function is as
				      * follows: it accepts as
				      * parameters two DoF Handlers,
				      * the first of which refers to
				      * the coarse grid and the second
				      * of which is the fine grid. On
				      * both, a finite element is
				      * represented by the DoF handler
				      * objects, which will usually
				      * have several components, which
				      * may belong to different finite
				      * elements. The second and
				      * fourth parameter of this
				      * function therefore state which
				      * variable on the coarse grid
				      * shall be used to restrict the
				      * stated component on the fine
				      * grid. Of course, the finite
				      * elements used for the
				      * respective components on the
				      * two grids need to be the
				      * same. An example may clarify
				      * this: consider the parameter
				      * estimation mentioned briefly
				      * above; there, on the fine grid
				      * the whole discretization is
				      * done, thus the variables are
				      * ``u'', ``q'', and the Lagrange
				      * multiplier ``lambda'', which
				      * are discretized using
				      * continuous linear, piecewise
				      * constant discontinuous, and
				      * continuous linear elements,
				      * respectively. Only the
				      * parameter ``q'' shall be
				      * represented on the coarse
				      * grid, thus the DoFHandler
				      * object on the coarse grid
				      * represents only one variable,
				      * discretized using piecewise
				      * constant discontinuous
				      * elements. Then, the parameter
				      * denoting the component on the
				      * coarse grid would be zero (the
				      * only possible choice, since
				      * the variable on the coarse
				      * grid is scalar), and one on
