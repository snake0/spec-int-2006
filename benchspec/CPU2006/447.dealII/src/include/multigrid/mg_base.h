/**
 * Base class used to declare the operations needed by a concrete class
 * implementing prolongation and restriction of vectors in the multigrid
 * context. This class is abstract and has no implementation of
 * these operations.
 *
 * There are several derived classes, reflecting the fact that vector
 * types and numbering of the fine-grid discretization and of the
 * multi-level implementation are independent.
 *
 * If you use multigrid for your complete system of equations, you
 * will use MGTransferPrebuilt together with Multigrid. The vector
 * types used on the fine grid as well as for the multilevel
 * operations may be Vector or BlockVector. In both cases,
 * MGTransferPrebuilt will operate on all components of the solution.
 *
 * For mixed systems, it may be required to do multigrid only for a
 * single component or for some components. The classes
 * MGTransferSelect and MGTransferBlock handle these cases.
 *
 * MGTransferSelect is used if you use mutligrid (on Vector objects)
 * for a single component, possibly grouped using
 * <tt>mg_target_component</tt>.
 *
 * The class MGTransferBlock handles the case where your multigrid
 * method operates on BlockVector objects. These can contain all or a
 * consecutive set of the blocks of the complete system. Since most
 * smoothers cannot operate on block structures, it is not clear
 * whether this case is really useful. Therefore, a tested
 * implementation of this case will be supplied when needed.
