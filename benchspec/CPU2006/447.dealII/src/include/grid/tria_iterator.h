/**
 * This class implements an iterator, analogous to those of the
 * standard template library (STL). It fulfills the requirements of a
 * bidirectional iterator.  See the C++ documentation for further
 * details of iterator specification and usage.
 *
 *
 * In addition to the STL
 * iterators an iterator of this class provides a <tt>-@></tt>
 * operator, i.e. you can write statements like
 * @code
 * i->set_refine_flag ();
 * @endcode
 *   
 * Iterators are used whenever a loop over all lines, quads, cells
 * etc.  is to be performed. These loops can then be coded like this:
 * @code
 *   cell_iterator i   = tria.begin();
 *   cell_iterator end = tria.end();
 *   for (; i!=end; ++i)
 *     if (cell->at_boundary())
 *       cell->set_refine_flag();
 * @endcode
 *
 * Note the usage of <tt>++i</tt> instead of <tt>i++</tt> since this
 * does not involve temporaries and copying. It is recommended to use
 * a fixed value <tt>end</tt> inside the loop instead of
 * <tt>tria.end()</tt>, since the creation and copying of these
 * iterators is rather expensive compared to normal pointers.
 *   
 * The objects pointed to are accessors, derived from
 * TriaAccessor. Which kind of accessor is determined by the template
 * argument <em>Accessor</em>. These accessors are not so much data
 * structures as they are a collection of functions providing access
 * to the data stored in Tringulation or DoFHandler objects. Using
 * these accessors, the structure of these classes is hidden from the
 * application program.
 *
 * @section TIDiff Which iterator to use when
 *
 * @attention Application programs will rarely use TriaRawIterator,
 * but rather one of the derived classes TriaIterator or
 * TriaActiveIterator.
 *
 * <ul> <li> TriaRawIterator objects point to lines, cells, etc in the
 * lists whether they are used or not (in the vectors, also
 * <i>dead</i> objects are stored, since deletion in vectors is
 * expensive and we also do not want to destroy the ordering induced
 * by the numbering in the vectors). Therefore not all raw iterators
 * point to valid objects.
 *
 * <li> The derived class TriaIterator selects the valid cells, that
 * is, cells used somewhere in the triangulation hierarchy.
 *
 * <li> TriaActiveIterator objects which only loop over active cells.
 * </ul>
 *
 * @section TIPurpose Purpose
 *
 * Iterators are not much slower than operating directly on the data
 * structures, since they perform the loops that you had to handcode
 * yourself anyway. Most iterator and accessor functions are inlined.
 *
 * The main functionality of iterators, resides in the <tt>++</tt> and
 * <tt>--</tt> operators. These move the iterator forward or backward
 * just as if it were a pointer into an array. Here, this operation is
 * not so easy, since it may include skipping some elements and the
 * transition between the triangulation levels. This is completely
 * hidden from the user, though you can still create an iterator
 * pointing to an arbitrary element.  Actually, the operation of
 * moving iterators back and forth is not done in the iterator
 * classes, but rather in the accessor classes. Since these are passed
 * as template arguments, you can write your own versions here to add
 * more functionality.
 *
 * Furthermore, the iterators decribed here satisfy the requirement of
 * input and bidirectional iterators as stated by the C++ standard and
 * the STL documentation. It is therefore possible to use the
 * functions from the algorithm section of the C++ standard,
 * e.g. <em>count_if</em> (see the documentation for Triangulation for
 * an example) and several others.
 *   
 * @section TIImplementation Implementation
 *
 * The iterator class itself does not have much functionality. It only
 * becomes useful when assigned an Accessor (the second template
 * parameter), which really does the access to data. An Accessor
 * has to fulfil some requirements:
 *
 * <ul> <li> It must have two members named <tt>present_level</tt> and
 * <tt>present_index</tt> storing the address of the element in the
 * triangulation presently pointed to. These data have to be
 * accessible by all triangulation iterators listed above.
 *
 * <li> It must have a constructor which takes a Triangulation* and
 * two unsigned integers, denoting the initial level and index, as
 * well as a data object depending on its type.
 *
 * <li> For the TriaIterator and the TriaActiveIterator class, it must
 * have a member function <tt>bool used()</tt>, for the latter a
 * member function <tt>bool active()</tt>.
 *
 * <li> It must have void operators <tt>++</tt> and <tt>--</tt>.
 *
 * <li> It must declare a local <tt>typedef AccessorData</tt> which
 * states the data type the accessor expects to get passed as fourth
 * constructor argument. By declaring a local data type, the
 * respective iterator class may type-safely enforce that data type to
 * be one of its own constructor argument types. If an accessor class
 * does not need additional data, this type shall be <tt>void</tt>.
 * </ul>
 *
 * Then the iterator is able to do what it is supposed to. All of the
 * necessary functions are implemented in the <tt>Accessor</tt> base
 * class, but you may write your own version (non-virtual, since we
 * use templates) to add functionality.
 *
 * The accessors provided by the library are distributed in three
 * groups, determined by whether they access the data of
 * Triangulation, DoFHandler or MGDoFHandler. They are derived from
 * TriaObjectAccessor, DoFObjectAccessor and MGDoFObjectAccessor,
 * respectively. In each group, there is an accessor to cells, which
 * have more functionality.
 * 
 * @attention It seems impossible to preserve constness of a
 * triangulation through iterator usage. Thus, if you declare pointers
 * to a <tt>const</tt> triangulation object, you should be well aware
 * that you might involuntarily alter the data stored in the
 * triangulation.
 *
 * @note More information on valid and invalid iterators can be found
 * in the documentation of TriaAccessor, where the iterator states are
 * checked and implemented.
