/**
 *   This class provides several function that flag certain cells for
 *   coarsening or refinement based on a vector of ``error''
 *   indicators and some selection algorithm.  The central function is
 *   <tt>refine (const Vector &criterion, const double threshold)</tt>:
 *   it takes a vector of values, one per active cell,
 *   which denote the criterion according to which the triangulation
 *   is to be refined. It marks all cells for which the criterion is
 *   greater than the threshold being given as the second
 *   argument. Analogously,
 *   <tt>coarsen (const Vector &criterion, const double threshold)</tt>
 *   flags those cells for
 *   coarsening for which the criterion is less than the threshold.
 *
 *   There are two variations of these functions, which rely on @p refine and
 *   @p coarsen by computing the thresholds from other information:
 *   <ul>
 *   <li> @p refine_and_coarsen_fixed_number: this function takes a vector as
 *     above and two values between zero and one denoting the fractions of cells to
 *     be refined and coarsened. For this purpose, it sorts the criteria per cell
 *     and takes the threshold to be the one belonging to the cell with the
 *     <tt>fraction times n_active_cells</tt> highest criterion. For example, if
 *     the fraction is $0.3$, the threshold is computed to a value such that
 *     30 per cent of cells have a criterion higher than the threshold and are
 *     thus flagged for refinement. The flagging for refinement is done through
 *     the central @p refine function. For coarsening, the same holds.
 *
 *     The sorting of criteria is not done actually, since we only need one
 *     value, in the example above the criterion of the cell which is at
 *     30 per cent in the sorted list of cells. The order of cells with higher
 *     and of those with lower criteria is irrelevant. Getting this value is
 *     accomplished by the @p nth_element function of the <tt>C++</tt> standard
 *     library, which takes only linear time in the number of elements, rather
 *     than <tt>N log N</tt> for sorting all values.
 *
 *     A typical value for the fraction of cells to be refined is 0.3.
 *     However, for singular functions or singular error functionals, you may
 *     want to chose a smaller value to avoid overrefinement in regions which
 *     do not contribute much to the error.
 *
 *   <li> @p refine_and_coarsen_fixed_fraction: this function computes the
 *     threshold such that the number of cells getting flagged for refinement
 *     makes up for a certain fraction of the total error. If this fraction is 50
 *     per cent, for example, the threshold is computed such that the cells with
 *     a criterion greater than the threshold together account for half of the
 *     total error. The definition of the fraction is a bit counterintuitive, since
 *     the total error is the sum over all cells of the local contribution
 *     squared. We define that the fraction $\alpha$ be such that those
 *     elements with the greatest error are refined for which the condition
 *     $\sum \eta_K^2 \le \alpha\eta^2$ holds. Note that $\alpha$ is not
 *     squared. The sum runs over the mentioned
 *     cells, $\eta_K$ are the local error indicators and $\eta$ is the global
 *     indicator with $\eta^2 = \sum \eta_K^2$, with here the sum running over
 *     all cells.
 *
 *     For the bottom fraction the same holds: the threshold for coarsening is
 *     computed such that the cells with criterion less than the threshold
 *     together make up for the fraction of the total error specified.
 *
 *     This strategy is more suited for singular functions and error
 *     functionals, but may lead to very slow convergence of the grid
 *     if only few cells are refined in each step.
 *
 *     From the point of view of implementation, this time we really need to
 *     sort the array of criteria.
 *     Just like the other strategy described above, this function only
 *     computes the threshold values and then passes over to @p refine and
 *     @p coarsen.
 *
 *     A typical value for the fraction of the total error is 0.5.
 *   </ul>
 *
 *   There are other functions relying on different methods to flag
 *   cells for refinement or coarsening. See their documentation for
 *   further information.
 *
 *   For a more thorough discussion of advantages and disadvantages of the
 *   different strategies for refinement, see the paper of R. Becker and
 *   R. Rannacher titled "A Feed-Back Approach to Error Control in Finite
 *   Element Methods: Basic Analysis and Examples".
 *
 *   It is assumed that the criterion is a value in a certain norm over each
 *   element, such that the square of the total error is the sum over the
 *   squares of the criteria on the cells. The criteria shall be positive.
 *
 *   You can suppress coarsening or refining by giving zero as the fraction
 *   for one of the operations.
