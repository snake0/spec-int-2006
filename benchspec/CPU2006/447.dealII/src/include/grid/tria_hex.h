/**
 *   @p Hexahedrons denote the fundamental entities of triangulations
 *   in three dimensions. They are characterized by the (global)
 *   indices of the six bounding quadrilaterals.
 *
 *   A heaxhedron itself has one index, as far as the topological part
 *   handled in the triangulation is concerned: the index in the level
 *   it belongs to. The level index is implicitly given by the
 *   position in the <tt>hexes.hexes</tt> list attached to the information
 *   of each level of the triangulation.
 *
 *   For conventions on the numbering of faces, lines and vertices
 *   within a hexahedron, refer to the documentation of the
 *   Triangulation class.
