/**
 * This class provides a map between two grids which are derived from
 * the same coarse grid. For each cell iterator of the source map, it provides
 * the respective cell iterator on the destination map, through its
 * <tt>operator []</tt>.
 *
 * Usually, the two grids will be refined differently. Then, the value
 * returned for an iterator on the source grid will be either:
 * <ul>
 *   <li> The same cell on the destination grid, if it exists there;
 *   <li> The most refined cell of the destination grid from which the
 *      pendant of the source cell could be obtained by refinement. This
 *      cell is always active and has a refinement level less than that
 *      of the source cell.
 * </ul>
 * Keys for this map are all cells on the source grid, whether active or
 * not.
 *
 * For example, consider these two one-dimensional grids:
 * @verbatim
 * Grid 1:
 *   x--x--x-----x-----------x
 *    1  2    3        4 
 *
 * Grid 2:
 *   x-----x-----x-----x-----x
 *      1     2     3     4
 * @endverbatim
 * (Cell numbers are only given as an example and will not correspond
 * to real cell iterator's indices.) The mapping from grid 1 to grid 2
 * will then be as follows:
 * @verbatim
 *    Cell on grid 1         Cell on grid 2
 *          1  ------------------>  1
 *          2  ------------------>  1
 *          3  ------------------>  2
 *          4  ------------------>  mother cell of cells 3 and 4
 *                                  (a non-active cell, not shown here)
 * @endverbatim
 * Besides the mappings shown here, the non-active cells on grid 1 are also
 * valid keys. For example, the mapping for the mother cell of cells 1 and 2
 * on the first grid will point to cell 1 on the second grid.
 *
 * The implementation of this class is such that not only cell iterators
 * into triangulations can be mapped, but also iterators into objects of
 * type DoFHandler and MGDoFHandler. The extension to other classes
 * offering iterator functions and some minor additional requirements is
 * simple.
 *
 * Note that this class could in principle be based on the C++ <tt>map<Key,Value></tt>
 * data type. Instead, it uses another data format which is more effective both
 * in terms of computing time for access as well as with regard to memory
 * consumpion.
 *
 *
 * @sect2{Usage}
 *
 * In practice, use of this class is as follows:
 * @verbatim
 *                   // have two grids, which are derived from the
 *                   // same coarse grid
 *   Triangulation<dim> tria1, tria2;
 *   DoFHandler<dim> dof_handler_1(tria1), dof_handler_2(tria2);
 *   ...
 *                   // do something with these objects, e.g.
 *                   // refine the triangulations differently,
 *                   // distribute degrees of freedom, etc
 *   ...
 *                   // create the mapping
 *   InterGridMap<DoFHandler,dim> grid_1_to_2_map;
 *   grid_1_to_2_map.make_mapping (dof_handler_1,
 *                                 dof_handler_2);
 *   ...
 *   typename DoFHandler<dim>::cell_iterator cell = dof_handler_1.begin(),
 *                                           endc = dof_handler_1.end();
 *   for (; cell!=endc; ++cell)
 *                    // now do something with the cell of dof_handler_2
 *                    // corresponding to @p cell (which is one of
 *                    // dof_handler_1
 *     f( grid_1_to_2_map[cell]);
 * @endverbatim
 *
 * Note that the template parameters to this class have to be given as
 * <tt>InterGridMap<DoFHandler,2></tt>, i.e. the dimension is given explicitly and
 * no dimension is attributed to the first parameter, which here is
 * DoFHandler (and could equally well be Triangulation or MGDoFHandler).
