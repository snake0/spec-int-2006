/**
 * This class handles the history of a triangulation and can rebuild it after
 * it was deleted some time before. Its main purpose is support for
 * time-dependent problems where one frequently deletes a triangulation due
 * to memory pressure and later wants to rebuild it; this class has all the
 * information to rebuild it exactly as it was before including the mapping
 * of cell numbers to the geometrical cells.
 *
 * Basically, this is a drop-in replacement for the triangulation. Since it
 * is derived from the Triangulation class, it shares all the
 * functionality, but it overrides some virtual functions and adds some
 * functions, too. The main change to the base class is that it overrides
 * the @p execute_coarsening_and_refinement function, where the new version
 * first stores all refinement and coarsening flags and only then calls the
 * respective function of the base class. The stored flags may later be
 * used to restore the grid just as it was before. Some other functions
 * have been extended slightly as well, see their documentation for more
 * information.
 *
 * We note that since the triangulation is created in exactly the same state
 * as it was before, other objects working on it should result in the same
 * state as well. This holds in particular for the DoFHandler object, which
 * will assign the same degrees of freedom to the original cells and the ones
 * after reconstruction of the triangulation. You can therefore safely use data
 * vectors computed on the original grid on the reconstructed grid as well.
 *
 *
 * @sect3{Usage}
 * You can use objects of this class almost in the same way as objects of the
 * Triangulation class. One of the few differences is that you can only
 * construct such an object by giving a coarse grid to the constructor. The
 * coarse grid will be used to base the triangulation on, and therefore the
 * lifetime of the coarse grid has to be longer than the lifetime of the
 * object of this class.
 *
 * Basically, usage looks like this:
 * @verbatim
 *   Triangulation<dim> coarse_grid;
 *   ...                     // initialize coarse grid
 *
 *   PersistentTriangulation<dim> grid (coarse_grid);
 *
 *   for (...) 
 *     {
 *                           // restore grid from coarse grid
 *                           // and stored refinement flags
 *       grid.restore ();
 *       ...                 // do something with the grid
 *
 *       ...                 // flag some cells for refinement
 *                           // or coarsening
 *       grid.execute_coarsening_and_refinement ();
 *                           // actually refine grid and store
 *                           // the flags
 *
 *       ...                 // so something more with the grid
 *
 *       grid.clear ();      // delete the grid, but keep the
 *                           // refinement flags for later use
 *                           // in grid.restore() above
 *
 *       ...                 // do something where the grid
 *                           // is not needed anymore, e.g.
 *                           // working with another grid
 *     };
 * @endverbatim
 *
 * Note that initially, the PersistentTriangulation object does not
 * constitute a triangulation; it only becomes one after @p restore is first
 * called. Note also that the @p execute_coarsening_and_refinement stores
 * all necessary flags for later reconstruction using the @p restore function.
 * Triangulation::clear() resets the underlying triangulation to a
 * virgin state, but does not affect the stored refinement flags needed for
 * later reconstruction and does also not touch the coarse grid which is
 * used within restore().
