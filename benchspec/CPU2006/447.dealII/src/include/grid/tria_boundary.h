/**
 *   This class is used to represent a boundary to a triangulation.
 *   When a triangulation creates a new vertex on the boundary of the
 *   domain, it determines the new vertex' coordinates through the
 *   following code (here in two dimensions):
 *   @verbatim
 *     ...
 *     Point<2> new_vertex = boundary.get_new_point_on_line (line);
 *     ...
 *   @endverbatim
 *   @p line denotes the line at the boundary that shall be refined
 *   and for which we seek the common point of the two child lines.
 *
 *   In 3D, a new vertex may be placed on the middle of a line or on
 *   the middle of a side. Respectively, the library calls
 *   @verbatim
 *     ...
 *     Point<3> new_line_vertices[4]
 *       = { boundary.get_new_point_on_line (face->line(0)),
 *           boundary.get_new_point_on_line (face->line(1)),
 *           boundary.get_new_point_on_line (face->line(2)),
 *           boundary.get_new_point_on_line (face->line(3))  };
 *     ...
 *   @endverbatim
 *   to get the four midpoints of the lines bounding the quad at the
 *   boundary, and after that
 *   @verbatim
 *     ...
 *     Point<3> new_quad_vertex = boundary.get_new_point_on_quad (face);
 *     ...
 *   @endverbatim
 *   to get the midpoint of the face. It is guaranteed that this order
 *   (first lines, then faces) holds, so you can use information from
 *   the children of the four lines of a face, since these already exist
 *   at the time the midpoint of the face is to be computed.
 *   
 *   Since iterators are passed to the functions, you may use information
 *   about boundary indicators and the like, as well as all other information
 *   provided by these objects.
 *
 *   There are specialisations, StraightBoundary, which places
 *   the new point right into the middle of the given points, and
 *   HyperBallBoundary creating a hyperball with given radius
 *   around a given center point.
