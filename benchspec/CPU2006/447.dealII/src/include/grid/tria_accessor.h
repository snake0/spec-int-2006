/**
 * Implements the accessor class used by TriaRawIterator and derived
 * classes.
 *
 * This class offers only the basic functionality erquired by the
 * iterators (stores the necessary data members, offers comparison
 * operators and the like), but has no functionality to actually
 * dereference data. This is done in the derived classes.
 *
 * @section TAInternals Internals
 *   
 * There is a representation of past-the-end-pointers, denoted by
 * special values of the member variables #present_level and
 * #present_index: If #present_level>=0 and #present_index>=0, then
 * the object is valid (there is no check whether the triangulation
 * really has that many levels or that many cells on the present level
 * when we investigate the state of an iterator; however, in many
 * places where an iterator is dereferenced we make this check); if
 * #present_level==-1 and #present_index==-1, then the iterator points
 * past the end; in all other cases, the iterator is considered
 * invalid.  You can check this by calling the state() function.
 *
 * An iterator is also invalid, if the pointer pointing to the
 * Triangulation object is invalid or zero.
 *
 * Finally, an iterator is invalid, if the element pointed to by
 * #present_level and #present_index is not used, i.e. if the
 * <tt>used</tt> flag is set to false.
 *
 * The last two checks are not made in state() since both cases should
 * only occur upon unitialized construction through <tt>memcpy</tt>
 * and the like (the parent triangulation can only be set upon
 * construction). If an iterator is constructed empty through the
 * empty constructor, it sets #present_level==-2 and
 * #present_index==-2. Thus, the iterator is invalid anyway,
 * regardless of the state of the triangulation pointer and the state
 * of the element pointed to.
 *
 * Past-the-end iterators may also be used to compare an iterator with
 * the before-the-start value, when running backwards. There is no
 * distiction between the iterators pointing past the two ends of a
 * vector.
 *   
 * Defining only one value to be past-the-end and making all other
 * values invalid provides a second track of security: if we should
 * have forgotten a check in the library when an iterator is
 * incremented or decremented, we automatically convert the iterator
 * from the allowed state "past-the-end" to the disallowed state
 * "invalid" which increases the chance that somehwen earlier than for
 * past-the-end iterators an exception is raised.
