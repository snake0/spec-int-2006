<h2>Benchmark Description</h2>

<p>GemsFDTD solves the Maxwell equations in 3D in the time domain
using the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method. The radar
cross section (RCS) of a perfectly conducting (PEC) object is
computed. GemsFDTD is a subset of the code GemsTD developed in the
General ElectroMagnetic Solvers (GEMS) project.</p>

<p>The code consists of three steps, initialization, timestepping
and post-processing. More than 99% of the time is spent in the
timestepping.</p>

<p>The core of the FDTD method are second-order accurate
central-difference approximations of the Faraday's and Ampere's
laws. These central-differences are employed on a staggered
Cartesian grid resulting in an explicit finite-difference method.
These updates are performed in the module update_mod. The FDTD
method is also referred to as the Yee scheme. It is the standard
time-domain method within CEM.</p>

<p>An incident plane wave is generated using so-called Huygens'
surfaces. This means that the computational domain is split into a
total-field part and a scattered field part, where the scattered
field part surrounds the total-field part. This part only takes a
few percent of the total execution time. It uses the excite_module
to compute the shape of the incident fields.</p>

<p>The computational domain is truncated by an absorbing layer in
order to minimize the artificial reflections at the boundary. The
Uni-axial perfectly matched layer (UPML) by Gedney is used
here.</p>

<p>A time-domain near-to-far-field transformation computes the RCS
according to the Martin and Pettersson. This is handled by the
module NFT_mod. Fast Fourier transforms (FFT) are employed in the
post-processing of the NFT_mod.</p>

<p>The execution time is concentrated to five subroutines, two
update routines, two UPML routines, and the routine NFT_store.</p>

<p>The train case uses a slightly smaller computational domain and
a thinner absorbing-boundary-condition layer. Furthermore, the
near-to-far-field transformation is computed closer to the PEC
sphere and for different far-field locations (angles).</p>

<hr />

<h2>Input Description</h2>

<p>A main input file called yee.dat is needed. A number of PRIMARY
keyword can be given. They are always written in capital letters.
There are a total of nine primary keywords available. With the
exception of PROGRESS, they must all be present in yee.dat. A
PRIMARY keyword may have one or several Secondary keyword.</p>

<p>The PRIMARY keywords are used to define problem size, number of
time steps to be taken, the cell size, and the CFL value.
Furthermore, they are used for definitions of the excitation, an
incident plane wave, the absorbing layer at the outer boundary, and
the near-to-far-field transform. Finally the primary keyword PEC
and its secondary keyword Filename are used to specify a file that
contains a description of the PEC object.</p>

<p>The order in which PRIMARY keywords appear in yee.dat is
arbitrary. The same is true for the Secondary keywords.</p>

<p>In total, there are two input files, the main input file yee.dat
and the PEC description file.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Output Description</h2>

<p>Output is an ASCII file containing the requested RCS data. The
name of the output file is &lt;Filenamebase&gt;.nft where
&lt;Filenamebase&gt; is given in the input file under the PRIMARY
keyword NFTRANS_TD and the Secondary keyword Filenamebase.</p>

<p>Two Matlab scripts, farfieldgemsTD.m and rcsmain.m, are included
in 459.GemsFDTD/docs/matlab, which can be used to plot the RCS of
the PEC object. For the PEC sphere, an analytical reference
solution is supplied.</p>
