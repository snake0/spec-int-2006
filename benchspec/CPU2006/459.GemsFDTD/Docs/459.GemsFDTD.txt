Benchmark Description

   GemsFDTD solves the Maxwell equations in 3D in the time domain using the
   finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method. The radar cross section (RCS)
   of a perfectly conducting (PEC) object is computed. GemsFDTD is a subset
   of the code GemsTD developed in the General ElectroMagnetic Solvers (GEMS)
   project.

   The code consists of three steps, initialization, timestepping and
   post-processing. More than 99% of the time is spent in the timestepping.

   The core of the FDTD method are second-order accurate central-difference
   approximations of the Faraday's and Ampere's laws. These
   central-differences are employed on a staggered Cartesian grid resulting
   in an explicit finite-difference method. These updates are performed in
   the module update_mod. The FDTD method is also referred to as the Yee
   scheme. It is the standard time-domain method within CEM.

   An incident plane wave is generated using so-called Huygens' surfaces.
   This means that the computational domain is split into a total-field part
   and a scattered field part, where the scattered field part surrounds the
   total-field part. This part only takes a few percent of the total
   execution time. It uses the excite_module to compute the shape of the
   incident fields.

   The computational domain is truncated by an absorbing layer in order to
   minimize the artificial reflections at the boundary. The Uni-axial
   perfectly matched layer (UPML) by Gedney is used here.

   A time-domain near-to-far-field transformation computes the RCS according
   to the Martin and Pettersson. This is handled by the module NFT_mod. Fast
   Fourier transforms (FFT) are employed in the post-processing of the
   NFT_mod.

   The execution time is concentrated to five subroutines, two update
   routines, two UPML routines, and the routine NFT_store.

   The train case uses a slightly smaller computational domain and a thinner
   absorbing-boundary-condition layer. Furthermore, the near-to-far-field
   transformation is computed closer to the PEC sphere and for different
   far-field locations (angles).

Input Description

   A main input file called yee.dat is needed. A number of PRIMARY keyword
   can be given. They are always written in capital letters. There are a
   total of nine primary keywords available. With the exception of PROGRESS,
   they must all be present in yee.dat. A PRIMARY keyword may have one or
   several Secondary keyword.

   The PRIMARY keywords are used to define problem size, number of time steps
   to be taken, the cell size, and the CFL value. Furthermore, they are used
   for definitions of the excitation, an incident plane wave, the absorbing
   layer at the outer boundary, and the near-to-far-field transform. Finally
   the primary keyword PEC and its secondary keyword Filename are used to
   specify a file that contains a description of the PEC object.

   The order in which PRIMARY keywords appear in yee.dat is arbitrary. The
   same is true for the Secondary keywords.

   In total, there are two input files, the main input file yee.dat and the
   PEC description file.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Output Description

   Output is an ASCII file containing the requested RCS data. The name of the
   output file is <Filenamebase>.nft where <Filenamebase> is given in the
   input file under the PRIMARY keyword NFTRANS_TD and the Secondary keyword
   Filenamebase.

   Two Matlab scripts, farfieldgemsTD.m and rcsmain.m, are included in
   459.GemsFDTD/docs/matlab, which can be used to plot the RCS of the PEC
   object. For the PEC sphere, an analytical reference solution is supplied.
