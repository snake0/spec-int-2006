<flag name="DSPEC_CPU" class="mandatory">
SPEC_CPU is turned on by the SPEC framework. It is not allowed 
to undefine this macro.  In 459.GemsFDTD, it prevents the 
OpenMP directives from being visible to the compiler (for SPEC 
CPU, automatic parallelization is acceptable, but not 
directive-based parallelization).
</flag>

<flag name="USPEC_CPU" class="forbidden">
