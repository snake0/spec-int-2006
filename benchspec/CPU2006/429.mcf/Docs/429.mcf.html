<h2>Benchmark Program General Category</h2>

<p>Combinatorial optimization / Single-depot vehicle scheduling</p>

<hr />

<h2>Benchmark Description</h2>

<p>429.mcf is a benchmark which is derived from MCF, a program used for single-depot vehicle
scheduling in public mass transportation. The program is written in
C.  The benchmark version uses almost exclusively integer
arithmetic.</p>

<p>The program is designed for the solution of single-depot vehicle
scheduling (sub-)problems occurring in the planning process of
public transportation companies. It considers one single depot and
a homogeneous vehicle fleet. Based on a line plan and service
frequenciesd, so-called timetabled trips with fixed
departure/arrival locations and times are derived. Each of these
timetabled trips has to be serviced by exactly one vehicle. The
links between these trips are so-called dead-head trips. In
addition, there are pull-out and pull-in trips for leaving and
entering the depot.</p>

<p>Cost coefficients are given for all dead-head, pull-out, and
pull-in trips. It is the task to schedule all timetabled trips to
so-called blocks such that the number of necessary vehicles is as
small as possible and, subordinate, the operational costs among all
minimal fleet solutions are minimized.</p>

<p>For simplification in the benchmark test, we assume that each
pull-out and pull-in trip is defined implicitly with a duration of
15 minutes and a cost coefficient of 15.</p>

<p>For the considered single-depot case, the problem can be
formulated as a large-scale minimum-cost flow problem that we solve
with a network simplex algorithm accelerated with a column
generation. The core of the benchmark 429.mcf is the network
simplex code "MCF Version 1.2 -- A network simplex implementation",
For this benchmark, MCF is embedded in the column generation
process.</p>

<p>The network simplex algorithm is a specialized version of the
well known simplex algorithm for network flow problems. The linear
algebra of the general algorithm is replaced by simple network
operations such as finding cycles or modifying spanning trees that
can be performed very quickly. The main work of our network simplex
implementation is pointer and integer arithmetic.</p>

<p>Because there have been no significant errors or changes during
the years 2000 - 2004, most of the source code of the CPU2000
benchmark 181.mcf was not changed in the transition to CPU2006
benchmark 429.mcf. However, several central type definitions were
changed for the CPU2006 version by the author:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Whenever possible, long typed attributes of struct <tt>node</tt> and
struct <tt>arc</tt> are replaced by 32 bit integer, for example 
if used as boolean type. Pointers remain unaffected and map to 32
or 64 bit long, depending on the compilation model, to ensure
compatibility to 64 bit systems for truly large scale problem
instances.</p> </li>

<li><p>To reduce cache misses and accelerate program performance
somewhat, the elements of struct <tt>node</tt> and struct <tt>arc</tt>, respectively,
are rearranged according to the proposals made in "Memory Profiling
using Hardware Counters" by Marty Itzkowitz, Brian Wylie,
Christopher Aoki, and Nicolai Kosche (<a href=
"http://www.sc-conference.org/sc2003/paperpdfs/pap182.pdf">http://www.sc-conference.org/sc2003/paperpdfs/pap182.pdf</a>)</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Input Description</h2>

<p>The input file contains line by line</p>

<ul>
<li>the number of timetabled and dead-head trips (first line),</li>

<li>for each timetabled trip its starting and ending time,</li>

<li>for each dead-head trip its starting and ending timetabled trip
and its cost.</li>
</ul>

<p>Worst case execution time is pseudo-polynomial in the number
timetabled and dead-head trips and in the amount of the maximal
cost coefficient. The expected execution time, however, is in the
order of a low-order polynomial.</p>

<p>In the version for CPU2006 (429.mcf), new input files were
defined for test, train, and ref, with the goal of longer execution
times. The heap data size, and with it the overall memory
footprint, increased accordingly.</p>

<h2>Memory Requirements</h2>

<p>429.mcf requires about 860 and 1700 megabyte for a 32 and a 64
bit data model, respectively.</p>

<h2>Output Description</h2>

<p>The benchmark writes to two output files, <tt>inp.out</tt> and <tt>mcf.out</tt>.</p>
<ul>
<li><tt>inp.out</tt> contains log information and a checksum</li>
<li><tt>mcf.out</tt> contains
check output values describing an optimal schedule computed by the
program.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Programming Language</h2>

<p>ANSI C, mathematical library (libm) required.</p>

<h2>Known portability issues</h2>

<p>The header source file "prototyp.h", which is (indirectly)
required by all modules, contains the lines</p>

<pre>
  #ifndef _PROTO_
  #if defined(__STDC__) || defined(__cplusplus) || defined(WANT_STDC_PROTO)
  #define _PROTO_( args ) args
  #else
  #define _PROTO_( args )
  #endif
  #endif
</pre>

<p>All C functions (subroutines) are defined in the original
program with and without function prototypes, e.g.:</p>

<pre>
/* function defined externally: */

  extern long suspend_impl _PROTO_(( network_t *, cost_t, long ));

/* function defined in this module: */

  #ifdef _PROTO_
  long resize_prob( network_t *net )
  #else
  long resize_prob( net )
    network_t *net;
  #endif
</pre>

<p>In the SPEC version, 
<span style="font-family:monospace; white-space:nowrap">-DWANT_STDC_PROTO</span> 
is set as a required
compilation flag via the parameter file <tt>429.mcf/Spec/object.pm</tt>,
line</p>

<pre>
$bench_cflags='-DWANT_STDC_PROTO';
</pre>

<p>This line, controlling compilations performed within the SPEC
tool harness, has the effect that all compilers, predefining
<tt>__STDC__</tt> or not, use ANSI C prototyping. This is intended for
reasons of compatibility and standard adherence.</p>

<h2>Other information, WWW Resource</h2>

<p>Background information about the vehicle scheduling problem can
be found in the author's Ph.D. thesis "Optimal Vehicle scheduling
in public transit", which is available via WWW at the author's
homepage <a href="http://www.zib.de/loebel">www.zib.de/loebel</a> or at
ftp://ftp.zib.de/pub/zib-publications/books/Loebel.disser.ps.</p>

<p>The work horse in the benchmark 429.mcf is the code "MCF Version
1.2 -- A network simplex implementation", which is available for
academic use free of charge via WWW at www.zib.de. Information
about MCF is available in <a href=
"http://www.zib.de/Optimization/Software/Mcf/">http://www.zib.de/Optimization/Software/Mcf/</a></p>

<p>An excellent text book about the network simplex algorithm and
network flow in general is Ahuja, Magnanti, and Orlin: "Network
Flows: Theory, Algorithms, and Applications", Prentice-Hall, Inc.,
Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, 1993.</p>

<p>MCF had originally been developed for application in the public
transportation systems of Hamburg and Berlin (BVG). For BVG, bus
scheduling was optimized in 1998 on the basis of MCF; BVG also owns
usage rights to the software that has been integrated into their
planning system BERTA.</p>

<p>The MCF method for vehicle scheduling later has been integrated,
into the vehicle and personel planning system MICROBUS. This system
in now marketed by IVU Traffic Technologies AG (<a href=
"http://www.ivu.de">http://www.ivu.de</a>) to public transportation
companies; the bus service divions of the German and the Austrian
railway companies are among the licencees.</p>

<p>Compared with the original and the commercial versions, the
benchmark version has been simplified in the
I/O area, to keep the I/O content small. The main algorithmic part,
however, has been retained.</p>
