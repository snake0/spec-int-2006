Benchmark 429.mcf, Change History of the CPU2006 version
--------------------------------------------------------

January 2002
------------

First version supplied by the author, Andreas Loebel.

Source code  basically unchanged from the CPU2000 version.

Input (and output) sizes enlarged for CPU2006,
correlating with larger memory size during execution:

Target size (ref input) is now 900 MB in a 32-bit data model.
In a 64-bit memory model, it will be above the target size
of 1 GB but we consider this OK: By 2004, systems will
have more memory.


SPEC Benchathon, Jan. 28, 2002
-------------------------

Lines 
  #ident
removed from sources: Not ANSI C; the IBM compiler complains.

Changed some long to size_t for P64 portability


March 13, 2002
--------------

New version from Andreas Loebel, his numbering: 429.mcf-1.8.tgz
Calibrated the memory requirements as follows:
test 186 MB
train 280 MB
ref 899 MB

Additionally, incorporated the changes that were made locally during the
SPEC benchathon into the main version.

Generated documentation file, with most of the contents
copied from the respective documentation file for
181.mcf in CPU2000.

Changes made by the author:

A) Whenever possible, long typed attributes of struct node and struct arc are
   replaced by 32 bit integer whenever possible, e.g., if used as boolean
   type. Pointers remain unaffected and map to 32 or 64 bit long depending on
   the compilation model to ensure compatibility to 64 bit systems for truly
   large scale problem instances requiring more than 2 GB memory.

B) To reduce cache misses and accellerate program performance somewhat, the
   elements of struct node and struct arc, respectively, are rearranged
   according to the proposals made in "Memory Profiling using Hardware Counters"
   by Marty Itzkowitz, Brian Wylie, Christopher Aoki, and Nicolai Kosche.


December 3, 2004 rw
================

Reintroduced -DWANT_STDC_PROTO as a required flag for
SPEC benchmark compilations (File 429.mcf/Spec/object.pm).


February 21,, 2005 rw
==================

New version supplied by the author, with
- longer execution timwe (ref input)
- slightly reduced memory footprint
Both were requested at the SPEC OSG meeting
of January 2005.

Documentation updated, now available in HTML.
