<h2>Benchmark Name</h2>

<p>454.calculix</p>

<hr />

<h2>Benchmark Author</h2>

<p>Guido D.C. Dhondt &lt;dhondt &#x5b;at&#x5d; t-online.de&gt;</p>

<hr />

<h2>Benchmark Program General Category</h2>

<p>Structural Mechanics</p>

<hr />

<h2>Benchmark Description</h2>

<p>454.calculix is based on CalculiX, which is a free software 
finite element code for linear and
nonlinear three-dimensional structural applications. It uses the
classical theory of finite elements described in books such as the
work by O.C. Zienkiewicz and R.L. Taylor, "The Finite Element
Method", Fourth Edition, McGraw Hill, 1989. CalculiX can be used to
solve a variety of problems such as static problems (bridge and
building design), buckling, dynamic applications (crash,
earthquake resistance) and eigenmode analysis (resonance
phenomena).</p>

<p>CalculiX consists of two parts: CalculiX GraphiX, used for
generating an input file interactively and for visualization of the
results, and CalculiX CrunchiX, which sets up the finite element
equations and solves them. The module submitted as benchmark 454.calculix is
CalculiX CrunchiX.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Input Description</h2>

<p>The input basically consists of a mesh
describing the geometry of the structure, material properties,
geometric boundary conditions and natural boundary conditions. The
mesh is made up of elements containing nodes in which the solution
is to be determined. The material properties describe the type of
material the structure is made of. Examples of material behavior
are linear elastic (e.g. steel at low stress), hyperelastic (rubber
materials) and elastoplastic behavior (steel at high stress). The
geometric boundary conditions specify which parts of the structure
are constrained. For instance, a cantilever beam is fixed at one
end. This fixation is described by specifying that the
displacements at that end are zero. Finally, the natural boundary
conditions are the loads applied to the structure such as pressure
loads, centrifugal loading, temperature loading etc.</p>

<p>For the input, several keyword lines are provided. For instance,
the description of the nodes is started by the <tt>*NODE</tt> keyword line,
followed on the next line by the node number and the node's
coordinates in three-dimensional Euclidean space. The element
topology is started by an <tt>*ELEMENT</tt> keyword line, etc. For a
detailed description of the keyword lines the reader is referred to
the extensive documentation of CalculiX CrunchiX available in
454.calculix/Docs/calculix.pdf; or updated versions of documents
available for download at <a href=
"http://www.dhondt.de">www.dhondt.de</a></p>

<p>Usually, the geometry, the material description and the zero
geometric boundary conditions are put at the top of the file. Then
follow one or more steps containing the nonzero geometric boundary
conditions and the natural boundary conditions.</p>

<p>The reference example (input file: <tt>hyperviscoplastic.inp</tt>)
provided with the benchmark describes the deformation of a
compressor disk due to centrifugal load, i.e. the compressor disk
is rotated at high speed and the deformation and stresses in the
disk are analyzed. Only a segment describing one seventh of the
disk was modelled. The other six seventh are taken into account by
cyclic symmetry conditions. The material of the disk is a
combination of linear elastic, viscoelastic, Ogden-type and
Ramberg-Osgood-type material. Target of the calculation is the
displacement and stress field at full speed.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Output Description</h2>

<p>The output consists of variable fields
across the structure, usually the displacements and the stresses.
Output can be requested with the keyword lines <tt>*NODE PRINT</tt> and <tt>*EL
PRINT</tt> in the input file, in which case the results are stored in
the <tt>.dat</tt> file, or with <tt>*NODE FILE</tt> and <tt>*EL FILE</tt> lines. In the latter
case the results are stored in the <tt>.frd</tt> file for visualization with
CalculiX GraphiX. </p>

<p>The displacement results in the <tt>.dat</tt> file are
preceded by the line "<tt>displacements (vx,vy,vz)</tt>" and consist of a
list of nodes and the components of the displacement vector in
Euclidean space, one node per line.</p>

<p>The stresses (heading: <tt>stresses
(elem, integ.pnt.,sxx,syy,szz,sxy,sxz,syz)</tt>) are listed in the
integration points of the elements. To explain the concept of
integration points, note that an element can be visualized as a
deformed cube. The finite element method involves integration over
this cube, which is numerically performed by function evaluation in
so-called integration points. Stresses are most accurately
evaluated at these integration points. The stress results in the
<tt>.dat</tt> file consist of the element number, the integration point
number and the six stress components (the stress is a second-order
tensor).</p>

<hr />

<h2>Programming Language</h2>

<p>454.calculix is written in a mixture of Fortran 90 and C.
The Fortran parts do not use all capabilities of Fortran 90. Indeed,
they are more like Fortran 77 with some extra features such as
"exit" and "cycle" of Fortran 90. The Fortran used in CalculiX
CrunchiX is compatible with the GNU Fortran compiler. The
programming language C is used for dynamic allocation.</p>

<p>The idea of a pure C-language program was rejected because of
the large Fortran experiences of the author. A pure
Fortran 90 language program was rejected because no good free
Fortran 90 compiler existed. So, that's how the mix came into
being.</p>

<p>SPOOLES, the mathematical code to solve the set of linear
equations generated by CalculiX CrunchiX, is written entirely in
C.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Known portability issues</h2>

<p>By default, 454.calculix expects that your compiler supports
the C99 format <kbd>%zd</kbd>. If yours does not, you will notice that the file
<tt>SPECtestformatmodifier_z.txt</tt> will not validate. In such
cases, please try compiling with
<kbd>-DSPEC_CPU_NOZMODIFIER</kbd></p>
