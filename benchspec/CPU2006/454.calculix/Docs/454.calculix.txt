Benchmark Description

   454.calculix is based on CalculiX, which is a free software finite element
   code for linear and nonlinear three-dimensional structural applications.
   It uses the classical theory of finite elements described in books such as
   the work by O.C. Zienkiewicz and R.L. Taylor, "The Finite Element Method",
   Fourth Edition, McGraw Hill, 1989. CalculiX can be used to solve a variety
   of problems such as static problems (bridge and building design),
   buckling, dynamic applications (crash, earthquake resistance) and
   eigenmode analysis (resonance phenomena).

   CalculiX consists of two parts: CalculiX GraphiX, used for generating an
   input file interactively and for visualization of the results, and
   CalculiX CrunchiX, which sets up the finite element equations and solves
   them. The module submitted as benchmark 454.calculix is CalculiX CrunchiX.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Input Description

   The input basically consists of a mesh describing the geometry of the
   structure, material properties, geometric boundary conditions and natural
   boundary conditions. The mesh is made up of elements containing nodes in
   which the solution is to be determined. The material properties describe
   the type of material the structure is made of. Examples of material
   behavior are linear elastic (e.g. steel at low stress), hyperelastic
   (rubber materials) and elastoplastic behavior (steel at high stress). The
   geometric boundary conditions specify which parts of the structure are
   constrained. For instance, a cantilever beam is fixed at one end. This
   fixation is described by specifying that the displacements at that end are
   zero. Finally, the natural boundary conditions are the loads applied to
   the structure such as pressure loads, centrifugal loading, temperature
   loading etc.

   For the input, several keyword lines are provided. For instance, the
   description of the nodes is started by the *NODE keyword line, followed on
   the next line by the node number and the node's coordinates in
   three-dimensional Euclidean space. The element topology is started by an
   *ELEMENT keyword line, etc. For a detailed description of the keyword
   lines the reader is referred to the extensive documentation of CalculiX
   CrunchiX available in 454.calculix/Docs/calculix.pdf; or updated versions
   of documents available for download at www.dhondt.de

   Usually, the geometry, the material description and the zero geometric
   boundary conditions are put at the top of the file. Then follow one or
   more steps containing the nonzero geometric boundary conditions and the
   natural boundary conditions.

   The reference example (input file: hyperviscoplastic.inp) provided with
   the benchmark describes the deformation of a compressor disk due to
   centrifugal load, i.e. the compressor disk is rotated at high speed and
   the deformation and stresses in the disk are analyzed. Only a segment
   describing one seventh of the disk was modelled. The other six seventh are
   taken into account by cyclic symmetry conditions. The material of the disk
   is a combination of linear elastic, viscoelastic, Ogden-type and
   Ramberg-Osgood-type material. Target of the calculation is the
   displacement and stress field at full speed.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Output Description

   The output consists of variable fields across the structure, usually the
   displacements and the stresses. Output can be requested with the keyword
   lines *NODE PRINT and *EL PRINT in the input file, in which case the
   results are stored in the .dat file, or with *NODE FILE and *EL FILE
   lines. In the latter case the results are stored in the .frd file for
   visualization with CalculiX GraphiX.

   The displacement results in the .dat file are preceded by the line
   "displacements (vx,vy,vz)" and consist of a list of nodes and the
   components of the displacement vector in Euclidean space, one node per
   line.

   The stresses (heading: stresses (elem,
   integ.pnt.,sxx,syy,szz,sxy,sxz,syz)) are listed in the integration points
   of the elements. To explain the concept of integration points, note that
   an element can be visualized as a deformed cube. The finite element method
   involves integration over this cube, which is numerically performed by
   function evaluation in so-called integration points. Stresses are most
   accurately evaluated at these integration points. The stress results in
   the .dat file consist of the element number, the integration point number
   and the six stress components (the stress is a second-order tensor).

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Programming Language

   454.calculix is written in a mixture of Fortran 90 and C. The Fortran
   parts do not use all capabilities of Fortran 90. Indeed, they are more
   like Fortran 77 with some extra features such as "exit" and "cycle" of
   Fortran 90. The Fortran used in CalculiX CrunchiX is compatible with the
   GNU Fortran compiler. The programming language C is used for dynamic
   allocation.

   The idea of a pure C-language program was rejected because of the large
   Fortran experiences of the author. A pure Fortran 90 language program was
   rejected because no good free Fortran 90 compiler existed. So, that's how
   the mix came into being.

   SPOOLES, the mathematical code to solve the set of linear equations
   generated by CalculiX CrunchiX, is written entirely in C.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Known portability issues

   By default, 454.calculix expects that your compiler supports the C99
   format %zd. If yours does not, you will notice that the file
   SPECtestformatmodifier_z.txt will not validate. In such cases, please try
   compiling with -DSPEC_CPU_NOZMODIFIER
