!     INPUT:
!
!     amat:  material name
!     iel:   element number
!     iint:  integration point number
!     t1l:   temperature
!     epini: equivalent creep strain at the start 
!            of the increment
!     ep:    present equivalent creep strain; values of ep < epini
!            are equivalent to ep=epini.
!     dtime: time increment
!
!     OUTPUT:
!
!     svm:   present Von Mises stress
!     dsvm:  derivative of the Von Mises true stress with respect
!            to the present equivalent creep strain.
!            Numerically: change the present equivalent
!            strain with a small amount, calculate the amount
!            of change this causes in the present Von Mises
!            true stress, and divide the latter amount through the
!            former amount.
