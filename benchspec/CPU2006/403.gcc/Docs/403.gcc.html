<h2>Benchmark Name</h2>

<p>403.gcc</p>

<hr />

<h2>Benchmark Author</h2>

<p>Richard Stallman and a large cast of helpers. For a full list,

<h2>Benchmark Program General Category</h2>

<p>C Language optimizing compiler</p>

<hr />

<h2>Benchmark Description</h2>

<p>403.gcc is based on gcc Version 3.2. It generates code for an
AMD Opteron processor. The benchmark runs as a compiler with many
of its optimization flags enabled. </p>

<p>403.gcc has had its inlining
heuristics altered slightly, so as to inline more code than would
be typical on a Unix system in 2002. It is expected that this
effect will be more typical of compiler usage in 2006.  This was 
done so that 403.gcc would spend more time analyzing its source
code inputs, and use more memory. Without this effect, 403.gcc
would have done less analysis, and needed more input workloads to
achieve the run times required for CPU2006.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Input Description</h2>

<p>There are 9 input workloads in 403.gcc. These files are
preprocessed C code (.i files):</p>
<ul>
<li>cp-decl.i and expr.i come from the source files of 176.gcc from 
CPU2000. </li>

<li>166.i is made by concatenating the Fortran source files of a 
SPECint2000 candidate benchmark, then using the f2c translator to produce 
C code, and then pre-processing. </li>

<li>200.i comes via the same method from a previous version of the 
SPECfp2000 benchmark 200.sixtrack.</li>

<li>scilab.i comes via the same method from a version of the Scilab 
program.</li>

<li>Expr2.i comes from the source of 403.gcc, as does c-typeck.i.</li>

<li>g23.i comes from fold-const.c from 403.gcc, and s04.i comes from
sched-deps.c of 403.gcc</li>

</ul>

<hr />

<h2>Output Description</h2>

<p>All output files are x86-64 assembly code files.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Programming Language</h2>

<p>C</p>

<hr />

<h2>Known portability issues</h2>

<ol>
<li>Some of the optimizations 403.gcc performs require constant
propagation of floating point constants. These form an
insignificant amount of computation time, yet may depend on IEEE
floating point format to produce a correct result.</li>

<li>403.gcc is not an ANSI C program. It uses GNU extensions.</li>

<li>The initial port of 403.gcc was to a 64 bit system. It has
been successfully ported by SPEC to many 32-bit UNIX
implementations.</li>
</ol>
