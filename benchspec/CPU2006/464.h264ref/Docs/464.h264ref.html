<h2>Benchmark Author</h2>

<p>Karsten S&uuml;hring and 
<a href="http://iphome.hhi.de/suehring/tml/doc/lenc/html/contributors_8h.html#_details">many 
others</a> wrote the H.264/AVC reference software implementation.  (The list of contributors
may also be found in the benchmark tree, as 
<span style="white-space:nowrap; font-family:monospace;">$SPEC/benchspec/CPU2006/464.h264ref/src/contributors.h</span>.)</p>

<p>Tom Pycke &lt;Tom.Pycke &#x5b;at&#x5d; telenet.be&gt; has coordinated
packaging the reference version for use by SPEC.</p>

<h2>Benchmark Description</h2>

<p>464.h264ref is a reference implementation of 
H.264/AVC (Advanced Video Coding), 
the latest state-of-the-art video compression
standard. The standard is developed by the VCEG (Video Coding Experts Group)
of the ITU (International Telecommunications Union, <a href=
"http://www.itu.int">http://www.itu.int</a>) and the MPEG (Moving
Pictures Experts Group, <a href=
"http://www.chiariglione.org/mpeg">http://www.chiariglione.org/mpeg</a>)
of the ISO/IEC (International Standardization Organization,
<a href="http://www.iso.ch">http://www.iso.ch</a>). This standard replaces 
the currently widely used MPEG-2
standard, and is being applied for applications such as the
next-generation DVDs (Blu-ray and HD DVD) and video
broadcasting.</p>

<p>The 464.h264ref source code, which is part of SPEC CPU2006, is based on 
version 9.3 of the h264avc reference implementation downloaded from 
<a href="http://iphome.hhi.de/suehring/tml/index.htm">Karsten S&uuml;hring's website
</a> (interested readers can get the latest version of the h264avc reference software 
directly from <a href="http://iphome.hhi.de/suehring/tml/download/">here</a>). 
The original sources have been modified to ensure portability, 
validation, and fairness across multiple hardware and software platforms. Utmost care 
has been taken to keep the modifications to the minimum so as to ensure the 
integrity and intent of the original sources. 
</p>

<p>In the process of converting the original h264avc reference implementation sources
(version 9.3) to the SPEC CPU2006 benchmark 464.h264ref, the following changes were 
made: </p>
<ul>
<li>Put benchmark sources into the SPEC CPU2006 harness</li>
<li>Removed the sources for decoder since decoder is not part of 464.h264ref 
benchmark</li>
<li>Suppressed the printing of log files and encoded output to reduce I/O traffic</li>
<li>Made changes to ensure validation across multiple hardware and software 
platforms</li>
</ul>


<p>This benchmark encodes video streams using 2 different parameter
sets (*.cfg files):</p>

<ul>
<li>Basic profile (*_baseline.cfg): Good compression, fast encoding and decoding.
This profile can be used for real-time encoding applications such
as video conferencing.</li>

<li>Main profile *_main.cfg): Best compression. This can be used in
applications where no loss of data can occur (no <i>error
resilience</i> needed) such as the next generation DVD.</li>
</ul>

<p>These two parameter sets make sure the most processing-intensive
algorithms available in the standard are used during the
benchmark.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Input Description</h2>

<p>For the reference workload, we are using two different files for input. 
Both are raw (uncompressed) video data in YUV-format.</p>

<ul>
<li>Foreman (foreman_qcif.yuv): a standard sequence used in video compression,
consisting of 120 frames with resolution 176x144 pixels.</li>

<li>SSS (sss.yuv): a sequence from a video game, consisting of 171 frames
with resolution 512x320 pixels</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>Output Description</h2>

<p>The output for the reference run consists of 6 files:</p>

<ul>
<li><kbd>foreman_ref_baseline_encodelog.out</kbd>: the encode log from the foreman
sequence, encoded using the baseline profile.</li>

<li><kbd>foreman_ref_main_encodelog.out</kbd>: the encode log from the foreman
sequence, encoded using the main profile.</li>

<li><kbd>sss_main_encodelog.out</kbd>: the encode log from the SSS sequence,
encoded using the main profile.</li>

<li><kbd>*_leakybucketparam.cfg</kbd>: leakybucketparam.cfg file for each input.</li>
</ul>

<p>The output log files and leackybucketparam.cfg (binary format) files for all 
inputs are verified at the end of each run. </p>
