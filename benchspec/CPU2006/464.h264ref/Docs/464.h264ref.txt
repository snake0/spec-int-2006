Benchmark Author

   Karsten Su:hring and many others wrote the H.264/AVC reference software
   implementation. (The list of contributors may also be found in the
   benchmark tree, as
   $SPEC/benchspec/CPU2006/464.h264ref/src/contributors.h.)

   Tom Pycke <Tom.Pycke [at] telenet.be> has coordinated packaging the
   reference version for use by SPEC.

Benchmark Description

   464.h264ref is a reference implementation of H.264/AVC (Advanced Video
   Coding), the latest state-of-the-art video compression standard. The
   standard is developed by the VCEG (Video Coding Experts Group) of the ITU
   (International Telecommunications Union, http://www.itu.int) and the MPEG
   (Moving Pictures Experts Group, http://www.chiariglione.org/mpeg) of the
   ISO/IEC (International Standardization Organization, http://www.iso.ch).
   This standard replaces the currently widely used MPEG-2 standard, and is
   being applied for applications such as the next-generation DVDs (Blu-ray
   and HD DVD) and video broadcasting.

   The 464.h264ref source code, which is part of SPEC CPU2006, is based on
   version 9.3 of the h264avc reference implementation downloaded from
   Karsten Su:hring's website (interested readers can get the latest version
   of the h264avc reference software directly from here). The original
   sources have been modified to ensure portability, validation, and fairness
   across multiple hardware and software platforms. Utmost care has been
   taken to keep the modifications to the minimum so as to ensure the
   integrity and intent of the original sources.

   In the process of converting the original h264avc reference implementation
   sources (version 9.3) to the SPEC CPU2006 benchmark 464.h264ref, the
   following changes were made:

     * Put benchmark sources into the SPEC CPU2006 harness
     * Removed the sources for decoder since decoder is not part of
       464.h264ref benchmark
     * Suppressed the printing of log files and encoded output to reduce I/O
       traffic
     * Made changes to ensure validation across multiple hardware and
       software platforms

   This benchmark encodes video streams using 2 different parameter sets
   (*.cfg files):

     * Basic profile (*_baseline.cfg): Good compression, fast encoding and
       decoding. This profile can be used for real-time encoding applications
       such as video conferencing.
     * Main profile *_main.cfg): Best compression. This can be used in
       applications where no loss of data can occur (no error resilience
       needed) such as the next generation DVD.

   These two parameter sets make sure the most processing-intensive
   algorithms available in the standard are used during the benchmark.

Input Description

   For the reference workload, we are using two different files for input.
   Both are raw (uncompressed) video data in YUV-format.

     * Foreman (foreman_qcif.yuv): a standard sequence used in video
       compression, consisting of 120 frames with resolution 176x144 pixels.
     * SSS (sss.yuv): a sequence from a video game, consisting of 171 frames
       with resolution 512x320 pixels

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Output Description

   The output for the reference run consists of 6 files:

     * foreman_ref_baseline_encodelog.out: the encode log from the foreman
       sequence, encoded using the baseline profile.
     * foreman_ref_main_encodelog.out: the encode log from the foreman
       sequence, encoded using the main profile.
     * sss_main_encodelog.out: the encode log from the SSS sequence, encoded
       using the main profile.
     * *_leakybucketparam.cfg: leakybucketparam.cfg file for each input.

   The output log files and leackybucketparam.cfg (binary format) files for
   all inputs are verified at the end of each run.
