/*
 * $Log: BinHTTPURLInputStream.hpp,v $
 * Revision 1.4  2004/01/29 11:51:20  cargilld
 * Code cleanup changes to get rid of various compiler diagnostic messages.
 *
 * Revision 1.3  2003/12/17 00:18:37  cargilld
 * Update to memory management so that the static memory manager (one used to call Initialize) is only for static data.
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2002/11/04 15:11:39  tng
 * C++ Namespace Support.
 *
 * Revision 1.1.1.1  2002/02/01 22:22:23  peiyongz
 * sane_include
 *
 * Revision 1.5  2001/10/25 16:26:39  tng
 * [Bug 4213] BinHTTPURLInputStream initialisation not thread safe.  By Mark Weaver.
 *
 * Revision 1.4  2001/01/22 16:43:39  tng
 * Loads winsock dynamically.  Fixed by Curt Arnold.
 * Winsock2 is not initialized unless an http URL is used.    If an http
 * URL is used and the Winsock 2 DLL is not installed, then an NetAccessor
 * initialization exception is thrown.
 *
 * Revision 1.3  2000/07/21 03:22:45  andyh
 * Improved (but still weak) http access by the parser.
 * Windows only.  UNIX will follow, probably tomorrow.
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2000/03/22 00:21:10  rahulj
 * Now we throw exceptions when errors occur.
 * Simplified the code, based on the assumption that
 * the calling function will make sure that the buffer into
 * which the data has to be read is large enough.
 *
 * Revision 1.1  2000/03/17 02:37:54  rahulj
 * First cut at adding HTTP capability via native sockets.
 * Still need to add:
 *   error handling capability, ports other than 80,
 *   escaped URL's
 * Will add options in project file only when I am done with these
 * above changes.
