Benchmark Description

   471.astar (pronounced: A-star) is derived from a portable 2D path-finding
   library that is used in game's AI. This library implements three different
   path-finding algorithms: First is the well known A* algorithm for maps
   with passable and non-passable terrain types. Second is a modification of
   the A* path finding algorithm for maps with different terrain types and
   different move speed. Third is an implementation of A* algorithm for
   graphs. This is formed by map regions with neighborhood relationship. The
   library also includes pseudo-intellectual functions for map region
   determination.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Input Description

   The input file is a map in binary format. The program also accepts typical
   map region size which is used in region-based path finding algorithm and
   density for randomly created forest-style test maps. The program also
   reads the number of ways to simulate.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Output Description

   The program outputs the number of existing ways and the total way length
   to validate correctness.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Programming Language

   C++

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Known portability issues

   None
