ALIGN="justify"
>The first step in writing a module for TONTO is to decide whether you
really need to do that.</P
><P
ALIGN="justify"
>TONTO is organised around about thirty data objects. Writing a whole
module is a fairly serious undertaking in which you are required to define what
data the object is supposed to store, and what operations might be performed on
this data.</P
><P
ALIGN="justify"
>Initially, you might only want to add particular functionality or routine
to an existing module. </P
><P
ALIGN="justify"
>If you really do want to write a whole module, or slash TONTO to bits
for your own project, this chapter gives you the required procedure for
constructing or deconstructing a module. </P
><P
ALIGN="justify"
>A particular style has been adopted within TONTO. This is not just for
aesthetics.  We believe that adhering to such a style will make it relatively
easy to port <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>foo</I
></SPAN
> code to other languages. Hopefully this will not be a
neccesity, but writing code which has a multilingual character can only help in
its maintainence and understandability.</P

>What is the module supposed to do?</H1
><P
ALIGN="justify"
>First, you must decide what the module is supposed to do. But this does
<SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>not</I
></SPAN
> define a module in TONTO.</P
><P
ALIGN="justify"
>Instead, a module is defined by the <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>data</I
></SPAN
> which is
required to do the task.</P
><P
ALIGN="justify"
>Many people, especially Fortran programmers, come from a top-down design
philosophy. In this philosophy a desired task is broken into smaller bits, which
are eventually coded as separate routines. This philosophy must be
resisted.</P
><P
ALIGN="justify"
>For example, a common task in quantum chemistry is the requirement for
<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"integrals"</SPAN
>. A typical Fortran programmer would write code for the
formulas required, breaking the code up into routines to save repetitive coding.
At the last stage, the programmer would write input routines, or provide
subroutine arguments, so the user could provide the data required to evaluate
the formulas. The final result would be a Fortran routine like this
<TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#DDDDEE"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>   call evaluate_integrals(result,input_data_1,input_data_2, ....)</PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>
In a worst case scenario, common blocks and I/O statements would also
be used to introduce the required data into the routine.</P
><P
ALIGN="justify"
>By contrast, in an object-based design philosophy, you would start by
asking what data is required for the integrals. If you are using gaussian
functions, that data might be the information required to define these gaussian
functions. All this data would be used to define a <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>gaussian</TT
>
data type.  Routines and functionality would be provided so that the user could
introduce this data using I/O, or perhaps from other data types. The ability to
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>evaluate_integrals</TT
> would only be one of many tasks that could
be performed on the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>guassian</TT
>. The final result in TONTO
would be some lines like this
<TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#DDDDEE"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>   gaussian.read_data_from(stdin)
   gaussian.evaluate_integrals(result)</PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>
In all cases, the interface to the routine is constant and involves the
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>gaussian</TT
> data. </P
><P
ALIGN="justify"
>It is the encapsulation of data and functionality together, and the set
way to access a routine by its interface, which allows the object-based approach
better suited for large scale programs.</P
><P
ALIGN="justify"
>Whereas in the top-down design approach the details of how a task is
broken down may vary from programmer to programmer, in the object-based approach
used in TONTO the data required for a task, and the functionality that can be
performed on that data remains fairly universal within a specified problem
context.</P
