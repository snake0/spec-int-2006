<h2>Benchmark Name</h2>

<p>465.tonto</p>

<hr />

<h2>Benchmark Author</h2>

<p>Daniel J. Grimwood &lt;reaper &#x5b;at&#x5d; theochem.uwa.edu.au&gt;</p>

<hr />

<h2>Benchmark Program General Category</h2>

<p>Quantum Crystallography</p>

<hr />

<h2>Benchmark Description</h2>

<p>Tonto<a href="#ref1"><sup>1</sup></a> is an open source quantum
chemistry package, designed by Dylan Jayatilaka and Daniel J.
Grimwood. Objectives include simplicity and portability; aspects
not seen in many quantum chemistry codes. The code is easily
extendable by chemists with limited programming skills and time,
and is easy to understand and use<a href=
"#ref2"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>

<p>Tonto is written within an object oriented design, in Fortran
95. It uses derived types and modules to represent classes. Classes
range from integers and text files, through to atoms, spacegroups
and molecules. There is a "self" variable in most routines, which
should be familiar from many OO languages. Tonto uses dynamic
memory instead of common blocks, and uses array operations where
possible.</p>

<p>The profiles of Tonto calculations are typical of many <i>ab
initio</i> quantum chemistry packages. That is, a large portion is
dedicated to the evaluation of integrals between products of
Gaussian basis functions.</p>

<p>The SPEC reference calculation is in the field of quantum
crystallography. It places a constraint on a molecular Hartree-Fock
wavefunction calculation to better match experimental X-ray
diffraction data<a href="#ref3"><sup>3</sup></a>. It is expected
that other similar properties calculated from the constrained
wavefunction should also agree better with experiment.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Input Description</h2>

<p>The input file contains the crystal structure, atom positions,
and basis functions, and experimental X-ray diffraction data. It
then gives calculation parameters, and does the calculation. The
crystal structure, atom positions, and X-ray data are from the
literature<a href="#ref4"><sup>4</sup></a>.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Output Description</h2>

<p>The main output file is regularly updated to show how far the
calculation is from the final answer. Once the final model
wavefunction is obtained, the X-ray diffraction data calculated
from it are printed out together with the experimental data and
compared. The chi<sup>2</sup> of one means the calculated and
experimental data sets agree to within experimental accuracy.</p>

<p>The coefficients for the wavefunction are stored in the file
"n2o4.molecular_orbitals,restricted,ascii". Although not done so in
the 465.tonto reference calculation, this data can then be used to
calculate other properties of the system, such as the Electron
Localisation Function or the electrostatic potential<a href=
"#ref5"><sup>5</sup></a>.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Programming Language</h2>

<p>Fortran 95</p>

<hr />

<h2>Known portability issues</h2>

<p>Tonto makes extensive use of new features added to the Fortran
language with the Fortran 90/95 standards (such as generic
interfaces and vector subscripts). Some older compilers may not
have complete support for these features; therefore, users may wish
to obtain the most recent update of their compiler before trying
Tonto.</p>
