# Changed correct answer from K12 to J12. /gf
# K14 also secures a connection of all important stones but is one
# point worse than J12. K12 loses the tail.

# It seems that GNU Go makes a logical mistake here: After seeing that
# R9 can be defended with S7, and that Q8 can be defended with S7, I

# I have some doubt about the correct move. I might be advisable for B
# to defend his center group, although W E16 hurts, of course. However,
# W's attack after W N11, B N12 and next W L9 or similar might be
# very useful as well.
