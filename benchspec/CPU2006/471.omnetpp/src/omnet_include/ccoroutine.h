 *
 * On Windows, it uses the Win32 Fiber API.

 * On other platforms, the implementation a portable coroutine library,
 * first described by Stig Kofoed ("Portable coroutines", see the Manual
 * for a better reference). It creates all coroutine stacks within the main
 * stack, and uses setjmp()/longjmp() for context switching. This
 * implies that the maximum stack space allowed by the operating system
 * for the OMNeT++ process must be sufficiently high (several,
 * maybe several hundred megabytes), otherwise a segmentation fault
 * will occur.
