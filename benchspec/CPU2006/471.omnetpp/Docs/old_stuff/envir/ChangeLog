2003-06-16  ------ omnetpp-2.3 released ------

2003-03-15  ------ omnetpp-2.3b2 released ------

2003-03-15  Andras Varga

	* cinifile.cc/h: bugfix: complained about unterminated last line

2003-03-04  Andras Varga

	* cinifile.cc/h: made it faster to process large ini files (added
	haswildcard field) 

2003-02-15  ------ omnetpp-2.3b1 released ------

2003-02-14  Andras Varga

	* cinifile.cc: improved handling of lines ~ 1024 chars

2003-01-07  Andras Varga

	* implemented ev.flush()

2002-10-20  Andras Varga

	* misc improvements

2002-10-07  Andras Varga

	* main.cc: added call to ExecuteOnStartup::executeAll().
	See new EXECUTE_ON_STARTUP() macro in include/ChangeLog.

2002-10-04  Andras Varga

	* error handling changed from simulation.ok() to exceptions.

2002-09-21  Andras Varga

	* filemgrs.cc, akoutvectormgr.cc: applied Steffen Sroka's patches 
	(thanks Steffen!). AKAROA_CFLAGS added to Makefile.in.

2002-07-08  Andras Varga

	* filemgrs.cc: added fname-append-host=true/false ini file setting.
	When turned on, appends the host name to the names of the output
	files (output vector, output scalar, snapshot files). This is 
	useful when the simulation is run on multiple machines concurrently
	(parallel independent runs (Akaroa) or parallel/distributed simulation),
	and all running instances write to the same directory (e.g. shared
	via NFS mount). [Idea from Steffen Sroka's Akaroa extension]

	* added akoutvectormgr.h/cc: integrated Steffen Sroka's Akaroa 
	extension that supports multiple independent replicated simulation runs.
	Akaroa can be activated by specifying
	  [General]
	  outputvectormanager-class=AkOutputVectorManager
	in the ini file. By default, all output vectors are under Akaroa 
	control; the <modulename>.<vectorname>.akaroa=false setting can be used
	to make Akaroa ignore specific vectors.
	For more info see the Akaroa home page and the OMNeT++ documentation.

	TBD: Akaroa integration into the makefiles; documentation

2002-06-13  Andras Varga

	* filemgrs.cc: 2 bugfixes: (1) output scalar file did not get opened
	sometimes; (2) output scalar file got removed between runs

2002-05-28  Frank Paehlke  <paehlke@tm.uni-karlsruhe.de>

	* filemgrs.cc: Use standard headers and namespaces if
	USE_STD_NAMESPACES is defined

2002-05-16  Ulrich Kaage  <kaage@int.uni-karlsruhe.de>

	* appreg.h (cOmnetAppRegistration): fixed declaration of className()

2002-05-04  ------ omnetpp-2.2 released ------

2002-03-11  Uli Kaage  <kaage@int.uni-karlsruhe.de>

	* filemgrs.cc (initVector): make sure that vp->name is not
	NULL. This would cause a crash on SUN Solaris
	(recordScalar): make sure name is not null

2002-03-03  Andras Varga

	* filemgrs.cc: increased precision of numbers in output vector files
	("%g" fprintf formats changed to "%.9g"). [suggested by George Young]

2002-03-03  Andras Varga

	* Various changes: management of output vectors, output scalars and
	snapshots were moved into to the user interface library. See following
	entries and include/ChangeLog.

	* cenvir.cc: implementation of new cEnvir methods (just forward calls
	to TOmnetApp.)

	* omnetapp.h/cc: new methods; plugin mechanism: cOutputVectorManager,
	cOutputScalarManager, cSnapshotManager. (see new file include/envirext.h)

	* ini file entries no longer supported: [General]/log-parchanges,
	[General]/parchange-file. (Parameter change logging no longer
	supported, see include/ChangeLog).

	* new ini file entries: [General]/outputvectormanager-class,
        outputscalarmanager-class, snapshotmanager-class. They specify the name
        of the output vector manager, etc class to be plugged into Envir.
        The classes must have been registered with Register_Class().
        The default values are cFileOutputVectorManager, cFileOutputScalarManager,
        cFileSnapshotManager.

	* filemgrs.h/cc: new files: implementation if plugin classes:
	cFileOutputVectorManager, cFileOutputScalarManager, cFileSnapshotManager

        * cenvir.cc: bugfix: TOmnetApp::shutdown() was never called from cEnvir.

2002-02-24  Andras Varga

	* exit with status 0 if simulation terminated normally (as determined
        by simulation.normalTermination), otherwise with status 1.

2002-02-14  Ulrich Kaage  <kaage@int.uni-karlsruhe.de>

	* omnetapp.cc (putmsg): Bugfix: if OMNeT++ dies shortly after a
	call to putmsg (e.g. SIGSEGV), the output might not be written
	(especially when redirecting to a file). A call to ::fflush()
	ensures that the stdout buffer is emptied.

2001-10-04 Andras Varga

	* cinifile.h, cinifile.cc: no more upper limit on size of ini file
        (tables are dynamically reallocated if needed)

2001-09-01 Andras Varga

	* CONST_CAST() replaced by const_cast<>()

2001-07-11 Andras Varga

	* omnetapp.cc omnetapp.h: Eric Wu's Tru64/MPI port.
        Added new ini file option: [General]/parallel-system=. Its value
        can be "PVM" or "MPI", defaults to "MPI".

2001-02-27  Andras Varga

	* ------ omnetpp-2.1 released ------

	* Borland C++ support removed: I deleted the project files
	(*.ide). I added equivalent Makefile.bc files (generated from the
	BC IDE), but they are completely unsupported at the moment. If
	there's interest, it's possible that later I'll add makefiles for
	the free command-line bc5.5 compiler.

	* ------ omnetpp-2.0p1 released ------

	* patch to prevent Unix linkers (falsely) report Speedometer as
	missing symbol


2001-02-06  Andras Varga

	* ------ omnetpp-2.0 released ------

	* added dllexport to Speedometer

2001-01-16  Andras Varga

	* added Speedometer class

2000-06-19  Andras Varga

	* bugfix: TOmnetApp::getOutVectorConfig() crashed when it was
	called with vecname being NULL (on Solaris; other systems seem to
	tolerate NULL being passed to sprintf() as a "%s" argument)
	[reported by Ulrich Kaage]

2000-05-07  Andras Varga

	* ------ omnetpp-2.0b5 released ------

	* ------ omnetpp-2.0b4 released ------

	* Makefile.vc improvements from Balazs Kelemen

2000-04-10  Andras Varga

	* TRUE/FALSE (defines) replaced by true/false (C++ keywords)

	* in printf() statements, all "%lf","%lg","%le" was replaced by
	"%f","%g","%e"

2000-04-10  Andras Varga (6-10)

	* changes to enable linking a Windows DLL from the library

	* the memoryIsLow() utility function was placed into this library,
	and now it works through a new TOmnetApp::memoryIsLow() function.

	* the "-u <user-interface>" command-line parameter is now
	understood by envir: this can be used to select the user interface
	if both Cmnenv and Tkenv is linked in (or is dynamically loaded).

	The [General]/user-interface= ini file option was also added, with
	the same functionality.

	This allows the user to link the simulation without Cmdenv and
	Tkenv, and load one of them at runtime, with a line like this in
	omnetpp.ini:

		[General]
	         load-libs=../../lib/tkenv.so
	         user-interface=Tkenv
        Or the command-line equivalent:

		mysim  -l ../../lib/tkenv.so  -u Tkenv

	To allow all the above, the setup procedure (cEnvir::setup()) and
	the constructor and the setup() function of TOmnetApp was
	reorganized.

2000-04-04  Andras Varga

	* dynamic registration of user interface (TOmnetApp) classes
	introduced.
	(The formerly used method didn't make it possible to create
	separate DLLs on Windows: envir.dll, tkenv.dll, cmdenv.dll).

	See appreg.h, the Register_OmnetApp macros in cmdenv.cc and
	tkapp.cc, and the chooseBestOmnetApp() function in envir.cc.

2000-03-26  Andras Varga

	* 'char *' pointers made const-correct (lots of 'char *' -->
	'const char *' replacements throughout the code)

2000-01-28  Andras Varga

	* ------ omnetpp-2.0b3 released ------

	* main stack size increased to 128K (omnetapp.cc)

2000-01-16  Andras Varga

        * improvements in cinifile.cc

2000-01-15  Andras Varga

	* ------ omnetpp-2.0b2 released ------

	* typo fixed in Makefile.in: $(CLFAGS) --> $(CFLAGS)

1999-08-30  Andras Varga

	* ------ omnetpp-2.0b released ------

        * Fixed a bug in omnetapp.cc which caused bogus reporting in the
	number of random number generators initialized from table and from
	ini file

1999-08-13  Andras Varga

        * cIniFile::readFile()'s include file handling modified. Now the
	included file doesn't need to start with a section header line:
	entries will use the current section header in the including file.
	BUT: section headers in the included file are not propagated back
	to the including file because it could lead to nasty behaviour.

1999-06-21  Andras Varga

        * all sources checked in under CVS

        * makefile.in modified for use with GNU Autoconf; also renamed to
	Makefile.in

        * version.log renamed to ChangeLog

        * removed support for DOS with BC3.1

1999-02-09  Andras Varga

        * small fixes

1998-07-24  Andras Varga

        * getDisplayString() added to cEnvir and TOmnetApp classes

        * display strings now can be taken from [DisplayStrings] or [Run
	nn] section of the ini file (hardcoded display strings take
	precendence over the ones in the ini file)

        * cIniFile edited -- getRaw() added

1998-07-20  Andras Varga

	Improved cIniFile: wildcards understood in keys; keys may contain
	whitespace Support for output vector configuration from ini file

        * getOutVectorConfig() added to cEnvir and TOmnetApp classes

        * output vector config is taken from [OutVectors] or [Run nn] section.

	  Syntax:
	    module.vectorname.enabled=yes/no
	    module.vectorname.interval=10s..30s
	  Output vectors are enabled by default.

1998-07-15  Andras Varga

        * small fixes

1998-07-10  Andras Varga

        * main stack size increased to 64K

        * new ini file option: [General]/load-libs=

1998-06-24  Andras Varga

        * modifications to cinifile.cc

        * return value of TOmnetApp::askYesNo changed from bool to int
	(-1==cancel)

        * other small fixes

1998-06-19  Andras Varga

	[Run-nn] section)
	(supported from sim162 up)

1998-05-20  Andras Varga

        * `ev << ..' conversions for doubles changed

1998-05-12  Andras Varga

        * bugfixes

1998-05-11  Andras Varga

        * multiple -f and -l options: several ini files and libraries can
	be loaded
	(If you want to do several simulation runs with their parameters
	in separate files, multiple -f will be very useful!)

        * ini files can include each other. Syntax:
	    ...
	    include second.ini
	    ...

        * wildcard parameters in ini files. Like:
	    [Parameters]
	    net.station[*].gen_rate=100
	  Wildcard characters are: * ?, and {} for range (using the conventional
	  [] would be very inconvenient because they would interfere with vector
	  indices).

1998-04-27  Andras Varga

        * new ini file option: [General] / total-stack-kb= Holds the total
	stack size (in KB) needed by module coroutines.

        * makefile can now create shared object (libenvir.so)

        * support for dynamic loading of libraries: -l command line
	option.  `foo -l ./token.so' (if `foo' is an OMNeT++ executable)
	will now load the token.so file at startup.

1998-03-26  Andras Varga

        * use of gets() eliminated

1998-02-15  Andras Varga

        * makefile made compatible with configure script;
	envir.a-->libenvir.a

1997-12-13  Andras Varga

        * for clarity, section name [All runs] changed to [Parameters]

1997-10-10  Andras Varga

        * added endl to cenvir.h. Example: ev << "Hello!" << endl;

1997-10-06  Andras Varga

        * further renaming; compatible with sim148

1997-10-02  Andras Varga

        * cleaned up & renamed several member functions; compatible with sim147

1997-08-17  Andras Varga

        * small bug in ini file reader fixed

        * readPerRunOptions(1) in TOmnetApp::setup() commented out

1997-08-17  Andras Varga

        * TOTAL_STACK increased to 2Mb

        * extrastack() support added

        * new ini file entry: [General]/netif-check-freq=  (default:1)

        * compatibility: sim146a

1997-08-08  Andras Varga

        * other [Slaves] options added that control whether different kinds of

	  textual messages should be routed to the console:
	     errmsgs-to-console=
	     infomsgs-to-console=
	     modmsgs-to-console=

        * updated for sim144c

1997-08-07  Andras Varga

        * omnetapp.cc: cNetSimpleMod corrected to cNetMod

        * compatibility: sim144a or later

1997-08-04  Andras Varga

        * fixed a bug with reporting how many rnd gens were initialized from table

        * [Slaves]/module-messages= flag added; works similarly to
	Cmdenv's.  Default value is NO: module messages from slaves do not
	appear on console.

1997-07-31  Andras Varga

        * a bug introduced in #96 fixed

        * [General]/number-of-runs= ini file setting was removed; its
	place is taken by [Cmdenv]/runs-to-execute=

        * added: cInifileSectionIterator

        * compatible with: cmdenv87 and up

1997-07-20  Andras Varga

	Ini file reader improved; '#' as well as ';' can be used for
	comments Improvements on distributed execution:

        * ini file options added to enable logging of messages produced by
	slaves:

	     [Slaves]
	     write-slavelog = true/false
	     slavelog-file = slave.log
	  Output between TSlaveApp creation and ini file processing is written in
	  the file "slave.log".

        * changed TOmnetApp::foreignputs()

1997-07-10  Andras Varga

        * makefile hacked upon to make it edible for Cygnus gcc

1997-07-06  Andras Varga

        * fixed a bug that caused segmentation fault if there was an error
	during system setup

1997-07-01  Andras Varga

        * printing tons of "genXX-seed=..." ini warnings suppressed

        * handling of boolean ini file entries improved

1997-06-27  Andras Varga

        * enable_modmsgs changed to disable_tracing

        * main stack enlarged from 16K to 32K (cenvir.cc)

1997-06-26  Andras Varga

        * enable_modmsgs flag added. If set to FALSE, makes ev.printf()
	and ev.puts() return immediately without doing anything.
	Motivation was to decrease overhead when running the simulation at
	full speed and module messages are not needed.

1997-04-22  Andras Varga

        * stepmode renamed to pause_in_sendmsg (compatibility: sim130 and above)

1997-04-11  Andras Varga

        * opt_helponly stuff (-h command-line option) moved to cmdenv package

1997-04-06  Andras Varga

1997-03-16  Andras Varga

        * Style of ini file [Machines] section changed from:

	    whale.hit.bme.hu = node1, node2
	    dolphin.hit.bme.hu = node3
	  to:
	    node1 = whale.hit.bme.hu
	    node2 = whale.hit.bme.hu
	    node3 = dolphin.hit.bme.hu

1997-03-15  Andras Varga

        * pvm stuff (cSlaveApp) modified

1997-03-10  Andras Varga

1996-12-01  Andras Varga

         * fixed linker problem (undefined symbol
	 `TSlaveApp::TSlaveApp(...)'

         * changed copyright message
