* DESCRIPTION
*
*   Collects all light sources in CSG union object (only those who are direct
*   children of the object, not childrens children light sources - this was
*   taken care of before) and adds them to local light list of every object
*   in the CSG union.
*   NOTE: Only pointers are changed, the original light source is still the
*   one in the CSG union, and once this light source has been deallocated,
*   the pointers will be invalid.  Note that because of this we do not need
*   to (and we may not!) free the LLight lights of each object!
