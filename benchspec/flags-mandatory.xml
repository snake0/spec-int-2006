<!-- This file defines flags in the 'mandatory' class; that is, flags which are
     automatically supplied by the tools for ALL benchmarks.
     Flags in this class are ignored when doing per-flag checks for a
     particular run (because they are always present), but _are_
     output in the full flag report.

<h2>SPEC CPU2006 Default Flags</h2>

<p>These are the flags that are universally supplied by the tools harness.</p>
]]>
</header>

<flag name="DSPEC_CPU" class="mandatory">
The preprocessor macro SPEC_CPU is defined for all benchmarks compiled
by the CPU2006 tools harness.
</flag>

<flag name="USPEC_CPU" class="forbidden">
It is forbidden to undefine this mandatory flag.
</flag>

<flag name="DNDEBUG" class="mandatory">
The preprocessor macro NDEBUG is defined for all benchmarks compiled
by the CPU2006 tools harness.  It is used to disable asserts() in codes
that use them.
</flag>

<flag name="UNDEBUG" class="forbidden">
It is forbidden to undefine this mandatory flag.
</flag>

<flag name="DSPEC_CPU_WINDOWS" class="mandatory">
The preprocessor macro SPEC_CPU_WINDOWS is defined for all benchmarks
compiled by the CPU2006 tools harness on Microsoft Windows systems.
</flag>

<flag name="compile_opt" class="mandatory" regexp="-c\b">
This is a part of the default setting for OBJOPT for all platforms.  It
causes an object file to be generated from source.
</flag>

<flag name="unix_output" class="mandatory" regexp="-o [^\s\&quot;]+">
This option is used to specify the name of the output file on non-Windows platforms.
</flag>

<flag name="unix_mathlib" class="mandatory" regexp="-lm\b">
This is the default setting for MATHLIBOPT on non-Windows platforms.
</flag>

<flag name="windows_compout" class="mandatory" regexp="-Fo\S+\b">
This option is used to specify the name of the output object file on Windows platforms.
</flag>

<flag name="windows_ldout" class="mandatory" regexp="-Fe\S+\b">
This option is used to specify the name of the output executable on Windows platforms.
</flag>

<flag name="DSPEC_CPU_ILP32" class="portability">
This option is used to indicate that the host system's integers, longs, and
pointers are 32-bits wide.  Not all benchmarks recognize this macro, but
the preferred practice for data model selection applies the flags to all
benchmarks; this flag description is a placeholder for those benchmarks that
do not recognize this macro.
</flag>

<flag name="DSPEC_CPU_P64" class="portability">
This option is used to indicate that the host system's integers and longs,
are 32-bits wide, and pointers are 64-bits wide.  Not all benchmarks
recognize this macro, but the preferred practice for data model selection
applies the flags to all benchmarks; this flag description is a placeholder
for those benchmarks that do not recognize this macro.
</flag>

<flag name="DSPEC_CPU_LP64" class="portability">
This option is used to indicate that the host system's integers are 32-bits
wide, and longs and pointers are 64-bits wide.  Not all benchmarks
recognize this macro, but the preferred practice for data model selection
applies the flags to all benchmarks; this flag description is a placeholder
for those benchmarks that do not recognize this macro.
</flag>
