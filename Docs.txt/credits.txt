                            Credits for SPEC CPU2006

   Creating a suite of source code benchmarks to provide a consistent,
   comparative measure of CPU-intensive performance is not simple. The
   challenges are numerous, for example:

     * locating meaningful programs;
     * ensuring that they port to numerous environments;
     * defining rules to govern how the programs are compiled, run and
       reported;
     * developing a toolset to help enforce these rules while still making
       things easy to use; and
     * defining a process by which decisions can be made amongst the group
       working on the project.

   And in the end, you hope you have something that is fair, relevant, and
   understandable, that will address technology for a period of years.

   Such is the case with SPEC CPU2006, which is a worthy update and
   replacement for CPU2000. The new benchmark suite:

     * Increases the number of applications and application areas included in
       the suite.
     * Uses application source code that is significantly more complex.
     * Uses more memory at run time.
     * Improves the tools for running and using the suite.
     * Clarifies and updates the run rules.
     * Improves the documentation.

   All of this is due to the efforts of a large team of people from around
   the world, that SPEC would like to thank (with apologies and thanks to
   those who may not be listed).

  Program Authors and Contributors

   SPEC CPU benchmarks are based on real-world applications (rather than
   using loop kernels or artificial stress tests). We therefore thank the
   authors of those real-world applications.

   Thank you to the many participants of the "SPEC CPU Benchmark Search
   Program" and, in particular, the authors that contributed programs that
   were made part of the suite:

   A special thank-you goes to Mark Kremenetsky, who contributed 410.bwaves.
   Dr. Kremenetsky would be in the list just above were it not for the fact
   that he is an employee of a SPEC member company (SGI), and therefore not
   eligible for the Search Program.

   Thank you to the original authors of, and contributors to, open-source
   programs that were adapted by SPEC for inclusion in the suite. These
   programs include:

                 based on Perl by Larry Wall and a cast of thousands, along   
                 with many plug-in modules, including SpamAssassin by Theo    
   400.perlbench Van Dinter and many others, MIME::Base64, Digest::MD5 and    
                 HTML::Parser by Gisle Aas, MHonArc by Ed Hood, IO::stringy   
                 by Eryq, TimeDate by Graham Barr, and MailTools by Mark      
                 Overmeer.

   447.dealII    uses the Boost C++ libraries, with contributors numbering in 
                 the thousands

  SPEC

   We would also like to thank:

     * SPEC management, who provided us with resources, and kept the SPEC CPU
       Subcommittee on their toes:

          * Walter Bays - President, SPEC
          * Kaivalya Dixit - Long-time President, and Guiding Light of SPEC
          * Larry Gray - Treasurer, SPEC
          * Paula Smith, Michael Paton - Chairs, SPEC Open Systems Steering
            Committee
     * The SPEC office, who were the ones who really provided us with the
       resources:

          * Dianne Rice - Administration
          * Kathy Powers - Administration, including event coordination for
            "benchathons": SPEC's face-to-face gatherings to port the
            benchmarks.
          * Cathy Sandifer, Jason Glick - Webmasters

  Benchmark Project Leaders and Developers

   Most importantly, thank you to the people who sweated through technical
   details and porting issues, debated their view points vigorously, and were
   willing to drive issues to conclusion. Without these people this benchmark
   suite would truly not exist.

   A benchmark "Project Leader" serves as the focal point for porting a
   program to all the tested platforms, improves the stability of the code,
   removes code that SPEC does not want to test (such as platform-specific
   extensions), writes documentation, consults with both the author and the
   users, and generally tries to give each benchmark its best chance at
   making it through SPEC's testing process. Thank you to these project
   leaders:

     * Yusuf Abdulghani, Kaivalya Dixit, Tom Elken, Diego Esteves, Alan
       MacKay, Raj Panda, Michael Paton, and Myke Smith, each of whom served
       as the SPEC "Project Leader" for one of the benchmark candidates that
       was evaluated by SPEC.
     * Jim Koehler and Michael Wong, who served as project leader for 2
       benchmark candidates.
     * Bob Larson, Manas Mandal, and Joydeep Ray, who project led 3
       candidates.
     * Reinhold Weicker, who led 4 benchmark candidates.
     * Cloyce Spradling, who served as project leader 4 benchmark candidates.
       As the Release Manager, and tirelessly productive Toolsmaster, Cloyce
       also assisted every other project leader.
     * Anirudha ("Rahul") Rahatekar, project leader for 8 benchmark
       candidates.
     * John Henning, project leader for 12 benchmark candidates.
     * Kumaran Kalyanasundaram, project leader for 15 benchmark candidates.

   In addition to the above, many other people from the member companies
   assisted with benchmark development, including but not limited to Louis
   Barton, Chris Cambly, Mat Colgrove, Darryl Gove, Linda Hsi, Andreas
   Jaeger, Jim McInnes, Wendy Korn, Jeff Reilly, Hideki Saito, Alexey
   Starovoytov, Wilfried Stehling, Brian Whitney, and Joel Williamson.

  Analysis, Tools, Testing, and Documentation

   Analysis of the candidate benchmarks was a substantial task. Contributors
   to profiling and other forms of analysis included: Yusuf Abdulghani, Tom
   Elken, Darryl Gove, John Henning, Lizy John, Ajay Joshi, Jim Koehler, Bob
   Larson, Alan MacKay, Aashish Phansalkar, Rahul Rahatekar, Joydeep Ray,
   Cloyce Spradling, Wilfried Stehling, and Reinhold Weicker

   Cloyce Spradling is the primary author of the SPEC CPU2006 toolset.

   Thank you to all who submitted bug reports and RFEs for the tools, notably
   including Carl Ponder (5 bugs/RFEs), Joydeep Ray (5), Yusuf Abdulghani
   (6), Alan MacKay (7), Rahul Rahatekar (9), Manas Mandal (21), and John
   Henning (86). Cloyce himself submitted the largest number (198).

   Benchmark testing was coordinated by Yusuf Abdulghani.

   There were numerous bug reports and RFEs suggested for the benchmarks
   themselves, but there's not an easy way to give credit for vigor by the
   testers, since much of that effort happened in difficult-to-summarize
   email and in person at benchathons. You who attended benchathons, and
   stayed up late working on bugs, know who you are.

   Thank you to Julie Reilly for installation testing on Windows.

   John Henning is the primary author of the documentation. Cloyce Spradling
   wrote first drafts for most of the new features in CPU2006. Many others
   contributed updates and did reviews, including Yusuf Abdulghani, Kevin
   Ball, Miriam Blatt, Mat Colgrove, Mark Debbage, Rick Jones, Bob Larson,
   Rahul Rahatekar, Jeff Reilly, Cathy Sandifer, David Schmidt, Myke Smith,
   Wilfried Stehling.

  Behind the scenes

   Finally, we thank all of the people behind the scenes in the compiler
   groups, architecture groups and performance groups who supported their
   work for SPEC at their respective companies.

  The Bottom Line

   Thank you!

   Cloyce D. Spradling, Release Manager, SPEC CPU2006
   John L. Henning, Vice-Chair/Secretary, SPEC CPU Subcommittee
   Jeffrey W. Reilly, Chair, SPEC CPU Subcommittee
