Introduction

   The SPEC CPU2006 suite has been tested under Unix, Linux, Mac OS X and
   Windows XP systems. Your DVD can be installed under many operating
   systems.

   Reminder: the SPEC license allows you to install on multiple systems as
   you may wish within your institution; but you may not share the software
   with the public.

   This document covers the installation procedure for SPEC CPU2006 under
   Microsoft Windows.

   Note: Unless otherwise specified, refererences to "Windows" in this
   document apply to Windows XP, and Windows Advanced Server. Later and/or
   earlier versions of Windows/NT-based systems (such as Windows 2000) might
   also work, but have not been tested. Windows/98 and Windows/Me will
   definitely not work.

Installation Steps

   The installation procedure for Windows is as follows:

    1. Review the hardware and software requirements, in
       system-requirements.html

       Note: links to SPEC CPU2006 documents on this web page assume that you
       are reading the page from a directory that also contains the other
       SPEC CPU2006 documents. If by some chance you are reading this web
       page from a location where the links do not work, try accessing the
       referenced documents at one of the following locations:

          * www.spec.org/cpu2006/Docs/
          * The $SPEC/Docs/ directory on a system where SPEC CPU2006 has been
            installed.
          * The Docs/ directory on your SPEC CPU2006 distribution DVD.

       Note: the steps that follow assume that your DVD drive is on the same
       system as where you wish to install. If it is on a different system,
       please see the appendix.

    2. Open a Command Prompt windows (formerly known as an "MSDOS Window").
       Typically, this is done by selecting:
       Start-->All Programs-->Accessories-->Command Prompt.

       Adjust the properties to allow you to see plenty of lines scrolled off
       the top (for example, 9000). Click the upper left corner of the
       Command Prompt window, scroll down to "Properties", click the "Layout"
       tab, and in the section labelled "Screen Buffer Size" enter a new
       value for "Height".

    3. Check to see whether or not the temp environment variable points to a
       directory that can be used to hold for temporary files.

        C:\> echo %temp%
        %temp%

       If it's unset (just prints %temp%), you should set it to the full path
       (with drive letter) to a directory that can be used as scratch space.
       For example, if Kumaran would like to use a temporary directory
       underneath his directory on drive K:, he could type:

       C:\> set temp=K:\KUMARAN\TEMP

    4. Decide where you want to install the CPU2006 suite. You should make
       sure that your chosen destination disk has at least 8GB free. (For
       more information on disk usage, see system-requirements.html.) For the
       following examples, we will assume that your destination is on drive
       D:, in the directory \cpu2006.

    5. Change to the DVD directory. For the following examples, we'll assume
       that your DVD is mounted on drive E:.

    6. You're now ready to run the installer. The format for this command is

       install.bat destination_drive destination_directory

       For example, if your DVD is in drive E:, and you want to install
       CPU2006 on drive D:, you could type:

       C:\> E:
       E:\> install.bat  D:  \cpu2006

       Please notice the space between D: and \cpu2006. It's very important.

       You should see a message similar to the following:

       The environment variable SPEC should point to the source of the
       SPEC distribution (as an absolute path).  I will now try to set
       the variable for you...

       SPEC is set to E:\
       If this is NOT what you want, press control-C
       Press any key to continue . . . 

       If you see a message similar to the above, just press return. If you
       receive an error message such as:

       Access is denied

       then please verify that %temp% is defined (see above).

       If you see the message

       First parameter must be in the form c:

       make sure that you included the space between the drive name and the
       directory. If you did, and you still see the message, then make sure
       that your path includes the usual system directories. If it doesn't,
       you may be able to fix it by typing:

       E:\> set path=%systemroot%\;%systemroot%\system32;%path%

       If all goes well, you'll see several messages indicating that files
       are being unpacked. Please be patient - although only a few messages
       are printed, thousands of files are installed.

       The installation will consume around 1.5GB on your destination disk.

       After this step completes, you will find yourself in the destination
       directory that you selected.

    7. Read the comments to the file

       shrc.bat

       and make the appropriate edits for your compiler paths. Caution: you
       may find that the lines are not correctly formatted (the text appears
       to be all run together) when you edit this file. If so, see the
       section below: Using Text Files on Windows.

    8. Set the environment, using your edited shrc. For example:

       D:\cpu2006> shrc.bat

    9. Test that you can build a benchmark using the config file supplied for
       your system. Example config files can be found in %SPEC%\config. (For
       an introduction to config files, see "About Config Files" in
       runspec.html.)

       In the example below, "^" (often called "hat" or "carat") indicates
       line continuation:

       D:\cpu2006> runspec --action=build --tune=base ^
       More? --config=windows64-amd64-pgi.cfg 401.bzip2

       The --tune=base indicates that we want to use only the simple tuning,
       if the file contains more than one kind of tuning.

   10. Test that you can run a benchmark, using the minimal input set - the
       "test" workload. For example:

       D:\cpu2006> runspec --size=test --iterations=1 --noreportable ^
       More? --config=windows64-amd64-pgi.cfg 401.bzip2

       The --noreportable ensures that the tools will allow us to run just a
       single benchmark instead of the whole suite.

   11. Test that you can run a benchmark using the real input set - the
       "reference" workload. For example:

       D:\cpu2006> runspec --size=ref --config=windows64-amd64-pgi.cfg ^
       More? --iterations=1 --noreportable 401.bzip2

   12. Have a look at runspec.html to learn how to do a full run of the
       suite.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Using Text Files on Windows

   There are many files in the SPEC CPU2006 kit that contain text.
   Unfortunately, Unix systems and Windows systems have different conventions
   for storing text files. Sometimes, a text file formatted for Windows will
   appear on Unix as if it has extra Control-M characters. Sometimes, a text
   file formatted for Unix will appear on Windows as if all the lines were
   joined together.

   There are at least three ways for Windows users to correctly view and edit
   text files that originated on a Unix system:

    1. Use WordPad. WordPad can commonly be found by
       Start-->All Programs-->Accessories-->WordPad

    2. Use a Command Prompt and type "Edit". This alternative works only if
       the file has a short name with 8 characters or fewer, a dot, and then
       3 characters or fewer. If you are trying to use Edit with a longer
       file name, you can discover that there is an "8 dot 3" synonym for it
       by typing: "dir /x".

    3. Use the editor "vi". Although vi originated on Unix systems, it is
       also often found on Windows systems. For example:

          * There is a free ("charityware") version with some non-traditional
            features known as "Vi IMproved" (at http://www.vim.org/).

          * There is a version with the traditional Unix features in the MKS
            Toolkit (http://www.datafocus.com/products/tk/).

          * Also, there was a version with a subset of the traditional Unix
            vi features in the "Microsoft Windows Windows Workstation 4.0
            Resource Kit" (information available at
            http://mspress.microsoft.com); perhaps later resource kit
            versions also have it, but this has not been checked.

       Note that mention of these versions of vi is not intended as an
       endorsement by SPEC.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Example Installation

   Here is a complete Windows installation, with commentary. We assume that
   Steps 1 and 2 are already done (from the list of Installation Steps
   earlier in this document).

   Step 3: Check the temp environment variable.

 C:\>echo %temp%
 C:\TEMP

   Step 4: Create a place for the suite, and check space.

 C:\>D:
 D:\>mkdir cpu2006
 D:\>cd cpu2006
 D:\cpu2006>dir
  Volume in drive D has no label
  Volume Serial Number is F843-4C63

  Directory of D:\cpu2006

 06/01/2006  06:05 PM    <DIR>          .
 06/01/2006  06:05 PM    <DIR>          ..
                0 File(s)              0 bytes
                2 Dir(s)   6,964,436,992 bytes free

   Note that we have about 7GB of space on the destination drive, which is a
   bit smaller than recommended. This is enough space to demonstrate an
   installation, but would quickly fill up for actual "reportable" runs.

   Step 5: change to the drive where the DVD is mounted

 D:\cpu2006>e:

   Step 6: Actually do the installation. Note the presence of a space in
   between "D:" and "\cpu2006".

 E:\>install.bat D: \cpu2006
 The environment variable SPEC should point to the source of the
 SPEC distribution as an absolute path.  I will now try to set
 the variable for you...

 SPEC is set to E:\
 If this is NOT what you want, press control-C
 Press any key to continue . . .
 Installing from "E:\"

  Depending on the speed of the drive holding your installation media
  and the speed of your destination disk, this may take more than 5 minutes.
  Please be patient.

   Step 9. Use runspec to do a test build:

   At this point, we've accomplished a lot. The SPEC tree is installed, and
   we have verified that a benchmark can be compiled using the installed C
   compiler.

   Step 10. Now try running a benchmark, using the minimal test workload. The
   test workload runs in a tiny amount of time and does a minimal
   verification that the benchmark executable can at least start up:

   Notice about 15 lines up where it says "Success: 1x401.bzip2". That is
   what we want to see.

   Step 11. So, let's try running 401.bzip2 with the real workload. This is
   going to take a while - on the system used for the sample installation,
   about an hour.

   Done. The suite is installed, and we can run at least one benchmark for
   real.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Appendix: the DVD drive is on system A, but I want to install on system B. What
do I do?

   If the title of this section describes your situation, you basically have
   two choices.

    1. Network mount: You can mount the device over the network and do the
       installation remotely.
    2. Tar file: You can install from the tar file

  1. Network mount

   You might be able to mount the DVD on one system and use network services
   to make it available on other systems.

   Please note that the SPEC CPU2006 license agreement does not allow you to
   post the DVD on any public server. If your institution has a SPEC CPU2006
   license, then it's fine to post it on an internal server that is
   accessible only to members of your institution.

   Whether you attempt a network mount will probably depend on:

     * available network hardware,
     * the networking services provided by your operating system, and
     * the security policies of your IT department (if any).

   If your network environment allows easy cross-system mounting, you can use
   a network mount for the installation. Otherwise, you can fall back on the
   tar file.

   Note: if you insert the DVD on a system running Unix or Linux, you may
   need to share it using nfs commands. This Windows installation guide does
   not attempt to give hints about how to do Unix nfs commands, although you
   will find some hints in the corresponding appendix of
   install-guide-unix.html. Instead, let's assume that you are using two
   Windows systems. System A is a Windows system with a DVD drive; System B
   is a Windows system where you would like to do the installation.

   To do the installation:

    1. At System A, insert the DVD.

    2. Then, bring up a Windows Explorer window (for example, by double
       clicking on the My Documents icon). Click the plus sign next to My
       Computer and you should see the DVD drive. Let's suppose that it is
       drive F:.

    3. Right-click on the DVD drive and select "Sharing and Security..."

    4. In the box that comes up, under the "Sharing" tab, you may see a
       warning To protect your computer from unauthorized access, sharing the
       root of a dive is not recommended. If you understand the risk but
       still want to share the root of the drive, click here. This most
       informative warning is displayed for your consideration and you can
       proceed to consider it. If you decide that it is safe to share your
       DVD drive, then click where indicated.

    5. Select "Share this folder"

    6. Now, move to System B.

    7. Bring up a Windows Explorer window (for example, by double clicking on
       the My Documents icon). Select Tools -> Map Network Drive. The Drive
       letter may offer a default, such as Z:. In the box for Folder, type
       two backslashes, the name of system A, a backslash, and its shared
       drive letter - for example \\SystemA\F

    8. Continue with Step 2 above. When you get to Steps 5 and 6, remember to
       use the drive letter as it is known on System B - from the dialog box
       of a moment ago - for example

 D:\Documents and Settings\Saturos\> Z:
 Z:\> install.bat  C:  \cpu2006
   

  2. Tar file

   If the DVD drive is on a system other than the one where you wish to do
   the installation, and if you do not wish to try to get a network mount
   working, then the final fallback is to use the compressed tarfile. If you
   choose this option, please carefully observe the warnings.

    1. Go to the system with the DVD drive ("System A"). Insert the SPEC
       CPU2006 DVD.

    2. From a command window (aka terminal window), cd to the top level
       directory on the DVD.

    3. You are going to retrieve five things from the DVD. First, find the
       large tarfile and its corresponding md5 file:

 cd original.src
 dir cpu2006.tar.bz*

       or, if System A is a Unix system, then:

 cd original.src
 ls -l cpu2006.tar.bz*

       In either case, you should see one moderately large file > 400MB,
       cpu2006.tar.bz2, and a small file associated with it that contains a
       checksum, cpu2006.tar.bz2.md5.

       If you don't see the above files, try looking for cpu*tar*. The name
       might change if, for example, a maintenance update of CPU2006 changes
       the name slightly to indicate an updated version.

       Do whatever is required in order to transfer both files intact to the
       system where you wish to do the installation ("System B"). If you use
       ftp, do not forget to use image (binary) mode. For example:

 ftp> bin   <-------- important
 200 Type set to I.
 ftp> put cpu2006.tar.bz2
 ftp> put cpu2006.tar.bz2.md5

       Please note that the SPEC CPU2006 license agreement does not allow you
       to post the above file on any public ftp server. If your institution
       has a SPEC CPU2006 license, then it's fine to post it on an internal
       server that is accessible only to members of your institution.

    4. Next, you are going to retrieve specbzip2.exe, specmd5sum.exe, and
       spectar.exe from the DVD.

       Please do not use Windows Zip utilities, as these will not preserve
       line endings and will cause difficult-to-diagnose benchmark
       miscompares.

       Please do not use other tar utilities, as these may not handle long
       path names. Many commonly-supplied tar utilities cannnot.

       If you have GNU tar and the genuine bzip2, then you can use those;
       otherwise, look around on the DVD to find the SPEC-supplied versions,
       like so:

       Once you've found these versions of specbzip2, specmd5sum, and
       spectar, transfer them to system B using the same methods that you
       used for the big tarfile.

    5. On system B, use specmd5sum to check that the file transfer worked
       correctly. In this example, we assume that you have placed all 5 of
       the files mentioned above in the \kits\ directory on drive C::

 C:\kits\> specmd5sum -c cpu2006.tar.bz2.md5
 cpu2006.tar.bz2: OK

    6. Pick a disk with 8GB free, go there, and unpack the tarfile, like so:

 C:\kits\> H:
 H:\> mkdir cpu2006
 H:\> cd cpu2006
 H:\cpu2006\> C:\kits\specbzip2 -dc C:\kits\cpu2006.tar.bz2 | C:\kits\spectar -xf -

       Be patient: it will take bit of time to unpack! It might take 15
       minutes, depending on the speed of your processor and disks. Go for a
       coffee break.

    7. Now, type install, without any arguments afterwards. That is, unlike
       the instructions in step 6 above, you do not need to mention a device
       or directory if you are installing from the tarfile. You will see
       output similar, though not identical, to that shown in the example
       installation -- the messages about Unpacking xxxx are not printed,
       because you already did the unpacking with your spectar command.

    8. Continue with step 7, above.
