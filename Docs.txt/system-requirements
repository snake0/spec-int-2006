                        SPEC CPU2006 System Requirements

   Last updated: 3 June 2006 jh/mc/jr
   (To check for possible updates to this document, please see
   http://www.spec.org/cpu2006/Docs/ )

   To run and install SPEC CPU2006, you will need:

    1. A computer system running UNIX, Microsoft Windows, or Mac OS X. The
       benchmark suite includes a toolset. Pre-compiled versions of the
       toolset are provided that are expected to work with:

          * AIX: PowerPC systems running AIX 5L V5.1 or later
          * HP-UX: IPF running HP-UX 11iv2
          * HP-UX: HP-UX 11iv2 on PA-RISC
          * Irix: MIPS running IRIX
          * Linux/PPC: PowerPC-based Linux systems with GLIBC 2.2.1+, built
            on YellowDog
          * MacOS X: MacOS X 10.2.8+ on PowerPC G3+
          * MacOS X: MacOS X 10.4.3+ on x86
          * Redhat 6.2: x86- or x64-based Linux systems with GLIBC 2.1.3+
          * RHAS: Red Hat Enterprise Linux AS 3, and/or SGI ProPack 3
          * SLES: SuSE Enterprise Linux 9 on IA64
          * Solaris: SPARC with Solaris 8 and later
          * Solaris: x86 or x64 with Solaris 10 and later
          * SuSE: 64-bit AMD64 Linux systems
          * Windows: Microsoft Windows XP and Windows Server

       For systems not listed in above, such as earlier or later versions of
       the above systems, you may find that the tools also work, but SPEC has
       not tested them. Windows systems that are not based on NT, such as
       Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows ME, will definitely NOT work.
       Please see the Portability Notes below.

       In addition to the above list, there are several toolsets that are
       provided as a courtesy. These toolsets are expected to work, but have
       been tested much less extensively. More importantly, the benchmarks
       themselves have not been ported to these systems, so if you use one of
       them, you should be prepared to spend time on the porting effort.
       Please see the Portability Notes below.

          * FreeBSD 5.4: x86, built with GCC 3.4.2
          * FreeBSD 6.x: x86, built with GCC 3.4.4
          * NetBSD 2.1: x86, built with GCC 3.3.3
          * OpenBSD 3.8: x86, built with GCC 3.3.5
          * Tru64: Alpha Tru64 UNIX V4.0F or later
    2. A DVD drive

    3. Memory: typically 1GB on 32-bit systems, exclusive of OS/overhead; but
       more may be required:

          * The CPU2006 benchmarks (code + workload) have been designed to
            fit within about 1GB of physical memory, which is within the
            capabilities of systems that allow user applications to use 32
            bits of virtual memory (i.e. 4GB of virtual address space).

          * SPEC is aware that some systems that are commonly described as
            "32-bit" may provide a smaller number of bits to user
            applications, for example if one or more bits are reserved to
            privileged code. SPEC is also aware that there are many ways to
            spend profligate amounts of virtual memory. Therefore, although
            32-bit systems are within the design center for the CPU2006
            suites, SPEC does not guarantee any particular memory size for
            the benchmarks, nor that they will necessarily fit on all systems
            that are described as 32-bit.

          * The 1GB of RAM for the benchmarks (in 32-bit mode) does not
            include space needed for the operating system and other non-SPEC
            tasks on the system under test.

          * Typically, 64-bit environments will require 2GB for some of the
            benchmarks in the suite.

          * Attempting to run the suite with insufficient memory is strongly
            discouraged, as you will end up measuring the speed of your
            paging file, not the speed of your system running compute
            intensive workloads.

          * More memory will be needed if you run multi-copy SPECrates:
            generally 1GB for 32-bit, or 2GB for 64-bit, for each copy you
            plan to run.

    4. Disk space:

          * Typically you will need at least 8GB of disk space to install and
            run the suite. However, space needs can vary greatly depending
            upon your usage and system. The 8GB estimate is based on the
            following:

              1. Unpacked and installed, the suite takes approximately 1.5 to
                 2GB of disk space.
              2. When compiling your own binaries, the size of the build
                 directories and resulting objects will vary depending upon
                 your system, compiler, and compiler options. Estimate at
                 least 2 to 3GB of disk space per build. If you plan to
                 maintain multiple sets of binaries, each set will need
                 space.
              3. A single run (using binaries you have built, or using pre
                 built binaries from a separate source) takes an additional 2
                 to 3GB of disk space.

                 Note: If you plan to run SPECrate with multiple copies,
                 estimate an additional 2 to 3GB of disk space per copy. Note
                 that SPECrate must be run using a single file system, so
                 large runs will likely require some form of hardware or
                 software disk striping.

          * Minimum requirement: It is possible to run with about 5GB of disk
            space if: you are running only single-CPU metrics; you delete the
            build directories after the build is done; and you clean run
            directories between tests. See the discussion of disk space in
            runspec.html for more information about managing disk space.

       Note: links to SPEC CPU2006 documents on this web page assume that you
       are reading the page from a directory that also contains the other
       SPEC CPU2006 documents. If by some chance you are reading this web
       page from a location where the links do not work, try accessing the
       referenced documents at one of the following locations:

          * www.spec.org/cpu2006/Docs/
          * The $SPEC/Docs/ directory on a system where SPEC CPU2006 has been
            installed.
          * The Docs/directory on your SPEC CPU2006 distribution DVD.

    5. Since SPEC supplies only source code for the benchmarks, you will need
       either:

         1. A set of compilers for the result(s) you intend to measure:
              1. For SPECint2006: Both C99 and C++98 compilers
              2. For SPECfp2006: All three of C99, C++98 and Fortran-95
                 compilers

            --or--

         2. A pre-compiled set of benchmark executables, given to you by
            another user of the same revision of SPEC CPU2006, and any
            run-time libraries that may be required for those executables.

       Please notice that you cannot generate a valid CPU2006 result unless
       you meet all of requirement 5.a.1 or 5.a.2 or 5.b. For example, if you
       are attempting to build the floating point suite but lack a Fortran-95
       compiler, you will not be able to measure a SPECfp2006 result.

Portability Notes

   SPEC CPU2006 is a source code benchmark, and portability of that source
   code is one of the chief goals of SPEC CPU2006. SPEC has invested
   substantial effort to make the benchmarks portable across a wide variety
   of hardware architectures, operating systems, and compilers. During the
   development of SPEC CPU2006 testing was done on over 15 different hardware
   architectures and operating systems (including many variations of Unix,
   Linux, Microsoft Windows and the Mac OS).

   Despite SPEC's testing efforts, certain portability problems are likely to
   arise from time to time. For example:

     * Some platforms may not have a Fortran-95 compiler available.

     * Some older compilers may not include all the features needed to run
       the entire suite.

     * Sometimes, a new release of a compiler or operating system may
       introduce new behavior that is incompatible with one of the
       benchmarks.

   If you visit http://www.spec.org/cpu2006/ and look up results for SPEC
   CPU2006, you will find combinations of OS and compiler versions that are
   known to work. For example, if a vendor reports a SPECint2006 result on
   the SuperHero 4 using SuperHero Unix V4.0 with SuperHero C V4.0 and
   SuperHero C++ V4.0, you may take that as an assertion by the vendor that
   the listed versions of Unix, C, and C++ will successfully compile and run
   the SPEC CINT2006 suite on the listed machine.

   For systems that have not (yet) been reported by vendors, SPEC can provide
   limited technical support to resolve portability issues. See
   techsupport.html for information.
