                            Errata for SPEC CPU2006

   Last updated: 2 Aug 2006 jh

   This document describes known problems in SPEC CPU2006.

     * Problems may be added in the Open section from time to time. For the
       latest version of this document, you should check
       http://www.spec.org/cpu2006/Docs/errata.html.)

     * When problems are fixed, they are moved to the Closed section.

   Note: When updating this document, please do not ever re-use problem
   numbers.

Open Problem Reports

  1. Missing example-advanced.cfg

     * Problem summary: the advanced example config file has not been updated
     * Details: SPEC CPU2000 had a config file which demonstrated many
       advanced features. For SPEC CPU2006, the advanced example has not yet
       been developed.
     * Workaround: an advanced example might be added to www.spec.org/cpu2006
       at a later date; in the meantime, there are brief examples throughout
       config.html. You might also find that many of the cpu2000 features in
       www.spec.org/cpu2000/docs/example-advanced.cfg still work, but they
       have not been tested in the cpu2006 environment.

  2. Parallel builds aren't parallel on Windows

     * Problem summary: Benchmark builds on Windows effectively ignore the -j
       flag.
     * Details: Because the Windows build of GNU make requires sh.exe to be
       present in order to do parallel builds. No sh.exe is shipped with the
       SPEC CPU2006 tools, so using the option to do parallel builds will
       only result in a warning and a normal serial build.
     * Workaround: None.

  3. Reporting of seconds

     * Problem summary: Seconds are rounded to 3 digits in some reports
     * Details: For certain values, the SPEC tools print 3 significant
       digits. This is intentional. For example, if one system has a
       SPECint_rate2006 performance of 1234.456 and another has a
       SPECint_rate2006 performance of 1229.987, it is arguable that the
       performance of these systems is not materially different. Given the
       reality of run-to-run variation (which is, sometimes, on the order of
       1%), it makes sense to report both systems' SPECint_rate2006 as 1230.

       There was agreement that it is acceptable to round SPEC's computed
       metrics to 3 significant digits. However, it has been noted that the
       argument is weaker for rounding of original observations. In
       particular, if we wish to acknowledge the reality of run to run
       variation, then it seems reasonable to report a time of 1234.456
       seconds using an integral number of seconds (1234), rather than
       rounding to the nearest 10 seconds (1230).

       Results posted on SPEC's web site in reports such as the HTML, PDF,
       and text formats will use 3 significant digits for computed metrics,
       but seconds larger than 1000 will be reported as an integral number of
       seconds. A future maintenance update of SPEC CPU2006 will behave the
       same way. But for SPEC CPU2006 V1.0, you may notice that reports you
       generate for yourself round seconds to three significant digits.

     * Workaround: The above described rounding occurs only in the reports
       intended for humans, such as PDF, HTML, and text. But all available
       digits are still included in the raw files (.rsf), and in the file
       intended for use by spreadsheets (.csv). Therefore, if you prefer to
       see as many digits as possible, or would prefer to do your own
       rounding, then this is another good reason to use CSV output format.
       See the documentation for runspec --output_format csv.

  4. Unexpected message installing on Solaris/x86

     * Problem summary: unexpected "killed" messages occur while installing
       on Solaris/x86
     * Details: The lines shown in red below should not be present:

 ./install.sh

 SPEC CPU2006 Installation

 Top of the CPU2006 tree is '/data1/kumaran/kit97'
 specbzip2: Cannot find /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
 Killed
 specbzip2: Cannot find /lib/ld-linux.so.2
 Killed

 There appears to be only one valid toolset:

 solaris-x86                   Recommended for Solaris 10 and later
                               Built on Solaris 10 with Sun Studio 11

     * Workaround: The lines can safely be ignored. The suite figures out
       which tool sets to offer you by trying them. The above lines come from
       toolsets that are not actually compatible with Solaris-x86. But a
       moment later, the correct toolset is found and offered. Please ignore
       the extraneous messages.
