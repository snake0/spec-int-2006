	* VERSION 5.417 RELEASED

	* Require MIME::QuotedPrint 3.03 to use the three-argument
	"encode_qp" function.  If we have an earlier version of
	MIME::QuotedPrint, fall back to the one-argument version.

	* Field/ParamVal.pm: The patch to strip trailing whitespace on
	parameters was buggy and caused decoding errors.  This has been
	fixed.

	* VERSION 5.416 RELEASED

	* Allow MIME::Tools to work with MIME::QuotedPrint 2.20 again.
	The Makefile.PL will warn about potential problems, but will allow you
	to proceed.

	* Field/ParamVal.pm: Strip trailing whitespace when extracting
	parameters.  Apparently, not doing so can cause Perl to core dump
	on certain badly-formed messages.

	* VERSION 5.415 RELEASED

	* Fixed parsing of parameter="" in headers, and fixed case where
	multipart boundary is ""

	* VERSION 5.414 RELEASED

	* Remove MIME::QuotedPrint 3.03 as a dependency and add
	MIME::Base64 3.03 instead.

	* Check return values of I/O operations like open(), close(), etc.
	and die if they fail.  Problem reported by Mark Martinec.

	* VERSION 5.413 RELEASED

	* Fix some $VERSION = xxx assignments that were broken; make sure
	VERSION shows up as 5.413 everywhere.  Sorry about that!

	* VERSION 5.412 RELEASED

	* Recognize "binhex40", "mac-binhex" and "mac-binhex40"
	Content-Transfer-Encodings.

	* Filer.pm: Be much more strict in evil_filename, allowing only
	a set of known good characters.

2004-09-08  David F. Skoll  <dfs@roaringpenguin.com>

	* Skip BinHex decoding if prerequisite modules not installed.

	* Fix BinHex decoder so it encodes correctly; regression test for
	BinHex encoding now passes.

	* Require MIME::QuotedPrint 3.03 or newer.

	* Rename variable "$jkfis" to "$how_encoded"

	* Correct attribution of changes in changelog.

	* Correct bad regexp test for "bad PDF" files.
