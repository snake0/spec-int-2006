Tweakings to find the bzip2 distribution
========================================

Useful Environment variables
============================

Set these in the environment prior to running "perl Makefile.PL".

BUILD_BZLIB=Test
BZLIB_LIB=
BZLIB_INCLUDE=
BZLIB_BIN=

Set BZLIB_INCLUDE to the directory with bzlib.h in it.  There is no default.

Set BZLIB_LIB to the directory with libbz2.a in it.  There is no default.

Set BZLIB_BIN to the directory with the bzip2 command in it.  There is no default.

BUILD_BZLIB is a flag variable to control the building of
the internal, encapsulated version of bzip2 1.0.2.  The default is
BUILD_BZLIB=Test.

BUILD_BZLIB=1
* Means use the internal bzip2 distribution.

BUILD_BZLIB=0
* Means don't.  ever.

BUILD_BZLIB=Test
* Means try to compile a short program (show_bzversion.c) with the
  standard perl xs compile stuff, plus the settings for BZLIB_INCLUDE
  and BZLIB_LIB, if any.  If it fails, use the internal bzip2.  If it
  succeeds, rely on the system bzip2.

The defaults for these environment variables are in config.in.
