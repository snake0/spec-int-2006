Revision history for Perl extension XML::SAX::ExpatXS
=====================================================

1.08 April 22, 2005
    - feature 'http://xmlns.perl.org/sax/xmlns-uris'
      puts xmlns:* attributes into 
      the 'http://www.w3.org/2000/xmlns/' namespace
      and xmlns attributes into no namespace.
      The 'http://xml.org/sax/features/xmlns-uris'
      applies if the new one is off.
      The default behavior is the same as for other 
      Perl SAX parsers now.
    - fixed repeated parsing with Perl 5.6

1.07 March 16, 2005
    - feature  'http://xml.org/sax/features/xmlns-uris'

      the 'http://www.w3.org/2000/xmlns/' namespace.
      Default is no namespace (feature not set) which
      is a behavior different from previous versions!
    - feature 'http://xmlns.perl.org/sax/version-2.1'
      is set (and can't be turned off)
