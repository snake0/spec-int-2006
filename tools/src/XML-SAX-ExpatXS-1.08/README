1.Introduction
------------------------------

This module is an XS only implementation of PerlSAX2 parser 
using Expat. XML::SAX::Expat is implemented as a layer 
over XML::Parser.

This first version of this module has been created by Matt 
Sergeant reusing sources of XML::Parser. The current 
maintainer is Petr Cimprich <petr AT gingerall DOT cz>.

The wrapper is considered stable, however it must be used 
with caution and tested before a production deployment.
Feedback of any kind would be appreciated.


2. Callbacks
------------------------------

These PerlSAX callbacks are supported and tested:

 start_document()
 end_document()
 start_element()
 end_element()
 characters()
 processing_instruction()
 start_prefix_mapping()
 end_prefix_mapping()
 set_document_locator()
 fatal_error()
 comment()
 start_dtd()
 end_dtd()
 start_cdata()
 end_cdata()
 element_decl
 attribute_decl
 notation_decl()
 unparsed_entity_decl()
 external_entity_decl()
 internal_entity_decl()
 start_entity()
 end_entity ()
 resolve_entity()


These methods are never called by XML::SAX::ExpatXS:

 warning()
 error()
 ignorable_whitespace()


This one is deprecated but works:

 xml_decl()
