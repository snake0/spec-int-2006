                              This toolset is provided by SPEC as a courtesy;
                              the SPEC CPU2006 benchmark suite has not been
                              fully ported to this OS/architecture and is
                              therefore not supported.
                              Patches and other fixes are welcomed; please
                              send them to cpu2006support@spec.org.
